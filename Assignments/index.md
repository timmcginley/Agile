DTU Mars

Prototypes - ISS. - Reverse engineer this... ESA Mars base.
DTU Building

[DTU Research Facilities]


## Look back or forwards...
In groups of two decide if you are doing to look to the past or the future?

## [A1] How to Grow a Cup
* Id the problem and set ambitious requirements to solve it (build sys needs)
- learn method (cup / anything) - this we define.

## [A2] Building System Needs
* inspiration / research / reverse

## [A3] Prototype: 
* Building System Growth ()
* design something you think could do better (grow a building system)

## [A4] Test: 
* How to Grow a building
* test it - (does it work really)

## [A5] Reflect
* (did it work - how to do it better)

<!-- 2023

## A1 - Future
In this part you will:
* Envision a system that enables 'instant buildings'.
* Select a specific [gene system] to focus on.
* Explore the implications of instant buildings for different stakaholders.
* identify the near, medium and long term future that will provide the future context of your group's agile prototype.


## A2 - Needs
In this part you will:
* identify the requirements of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Introduce Agile Principles and Processes

## A3 - Analyse
In this part you will:
* Select a [gene system] to focus on.
* Identify artefact or system from contexts and its 'features'.
* ['Reverse engineer'] the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## A4 - Change
In this part you will:
* Develop or 
* Make a change to a system in an existing building model using a tool that you have developed
* Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios.
* Is your agile prototype aligned?
* if not can you align it?
