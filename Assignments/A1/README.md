This part identifies the near, medium and long term future that will provide the future context of your groups agile prototype. Introduce Agile Principles and Processes
Identify artefact or system from contexts and its 'features'.

Detail:
* Define your [future design experience]
* Define your building sytem for your group - individually gather the challenges to this system and hwo you will support your group.

All work should be compiled into a single [markdown] document. This can be directly submitted on Learn, or better you could share a link to your groups own github repository. Please see this link on the parallel advnaced BIM course for information about using [github].

## Submission Details

A markDown File that includes.

1. At least one paragraph for each future near mid and far (you will use these to generate needs in [A2])

1. System selection
1. [Gene] System focus with justification
1. Project Selection and justification
1. Planet A or B focus wiht justification.


## Learning Objectives
1. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
8. Define the three horizons of a future scenario and explore the future of the AP.
