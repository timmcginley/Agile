>Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Backcasting with the purpose of supporting the codesign of solutions.

In this part you will:
* Identify the requirements and features of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Extend traditional requirements engineering concepts to include [meta disciplinary analysis] of a selected building system.
* This stage introduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that you can define your solution objectives, based on your problem identification process in the previous stage.

This assignment results in the production of the Agile Future Design Plan. This involves a number of stages.

## 2.1 Define the future gap(s)
* What do we need to design / invent/ improve/ stop / discover or start to adapt to each of the Futures. please present the gaps for each.
* This will form the basis of your agile future development plan (AFDP). this should cover your selected gene systems from [A1].
## 2.2 Define System requirements. 
for each of your selected gene systems:
* Define the environmental impacts.
* Remember gene = environment + phenotypic.
## 2.3 Define System features
* Speculate features your prototype gene system could to address the requirements.
* When would these features be needed.
* Provide a timeline for the development of each of the features and includ this in your AFDP.
## 2.4 Define System Examples
* Identify specific products or systems that exist today that could be adapted to address the identified gaps and develop teh rewquiremetns to meet the required features.
* This could be more than one product or system that you imagine will synthesis into a hyrbid solution in your future(s).
## 2.5 Create a Science Fiction Prototype
* Produce a 1 page [science fiction prototype] that describes one of your Futures and how the feature(s) satisfy the requirement(s) you have idenitified for that future.
* This is a creative exercise it should be grounded in the thinking you have developed in the rest of the exercise.
* It should introduce a character that acts as the future user in your future case. Develop this persona so that it helps you to understand how you want your agile prototype to adpat to their future needs.
* It should describe the products of your selected gene systems in the future.

## Submission details
Simple report docuemnting the four stages in [Markdown] format.

## Learning Objectives
3. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
4. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
