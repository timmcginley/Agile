>Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Backcasting with the purpose of supporting codesign of solutions.

In this part you will:
* identify the requirements of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Extend traditional requirements engineering concepts so that they can used in meta disciplinary analysis of a selected building system.
* This stage introduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that students define their solution objectives, based on then problem identification in the previous stage.

this involves a number of stages.

## 2.1 Define the gap
* what do we need to design / invent/ improve/ stop / discover or start to adapt to each of the Futures. please present the gaps for each.
* this will form the basis of your agile future development plan (AFDP). this should cover your selected gene systems from [A1].
## 2.2 System requirements. 
for each of your selected gene systems:
* define the environmental impacts.
* remember gene = environment + phenotypic.
## 2.3 System features
* speculate features your prototype gene system could to address the requirements. when would these features be needed.
## 2.4 How would this happen? 
* provide a timeline for the development of each of the features and includ this in your AFDP.
## 2.5 Produce a [science fiction prototype]
* 1-2 pages that describes one of your Futures including the feature(s) you have described for that future.
* This is a creative exercise it should be grounded in the thinking you have developed in the rest of the exercise.


### Learning Objectives
3. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
