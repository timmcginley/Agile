![METHOD_02](https://github.com/timmcginley/Agile-Prototyping/assets/1415855/23c41df7-b987-4d23-9c3a-8144a56c896b)

In this part you will:
* identify the requirements of the future product / system in your defined future(s).

this involves a number of stages.

1. Define the gap, what do we need to design / invent/ improve/ stop / discover or start to adapt to each of the Futures. please present the gaps for each. this will form the basis of your agile future development plan (AFDP). this should cover your selected gene systems from [A1].
2. Read the requirements concept. for each of your selected gene systems. define the environmental impacts. remember gene = environment + phenotypic.
3. speculate features your prototype gene system could to address the requirements. when would these features be needed.
4. finally how would this happen? provide a timeline for the development of each of the features and includ this in your AFDP.
5. Produce a science fiction prototype 1-2 pages that describes one of your Futures including the feature(s) you have described for that future. This is a creative exercise it should be grounded in the thinking you have developed in the rest of the exercise.


### Learning Objectives
3. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
