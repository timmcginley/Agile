## A2 Building System Needs

|          |  Building Systems Features   |
|----      |-----|
|  Aim     |   Define the features of a building system (agile prototype)  |
| Tools    | Pen and paper / computational design |
| Case     | Building System (for focus area) |
| Groups   | Same group as A1 (2 to 3 people) |
| Practice | In class activity in week 3 and 4 |
| Output   | Drawings / digital prototypes (i.e. grasshopper) |
| Submit   | Markdown file |

For your chosen [focus] area, you need to do the following:

### 1. Identify the functions
* Define the functions of your chosen building system.
* What features of a cup support these functions?

### 2. Feature variables
* Imagine a universal design system for your building system;
  * How would your building systems features change for different building projects?
  * What variables would these features have?
  * Could you define the range of the variables that could support any building?
 
### 3. Out of order?
* Thinking procedurally, in what order would we apply functions to the design?
* Can we find a universal 'pseudo' developmental sequence for your building system?
* Which feature would appear first?

### 4. Is it growing?
* Could we consider these functional variables to be a bit like the suppression and expression of genes in a growing organism?

>Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Backcasting with the purpose of supporting the codesign of solutions.

In this part you will:
* Identify the requirements and features of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Extend traditional requirements engineering concepts to include [meta disciplinary analysis] of a selected building system.
* This stage introduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that you can define your solution objectives, based on your problem identification process in the previous stage.

This assignment results in the production of the [Agile Future Design Plan] (AFDP). This involves a number of stages.

## 2.1 AFDP_01 identify *Future Gaps*
for each of your [futures] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_01) description.
  
## 2.2 AFDP_02 Define *System Requirements*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_02) description.
  
## 2.3 AFDP_03 Define *System Features*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_03) description.
  
## 2.4 AFDP_04 Identify *System Examples*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_04) description.

## 2.5 AFDP_05 Identify *System Analysis*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_05) description.
  
## 2.6 AFDP_06 Create a *Future Case*
Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_05) description in a 1 page [science fiction prototype] that describes one of your Futures and how the feature(s) satisfy the requirement(s) you have identified for that future.

## Submission Details
Simple report docuementing the five AFDP stages in [Markdown] format (called A1-Team-XX). If doing it [Github], please remember to make the repository public so we can give your feedback. You are also welcome to upload it to Learn if you prefer.

## Learning Objectives
3. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
4. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
