### Learning Objectives
3. [Reverse engineer] the pseudo biological developmental stages of the system based on the identified features to transform the building system or product into an â€˜Agile Prototype' (AP).
5. Model and traverse a phylogenetic tree of the features of AP to identify new solutions.
6. Apply computational modelling techniques to model the evolution of the AP.
7. Extrapolate the future features of the AP based on its evolution.
