## A3 - Building System Growth Stages

|          |  Building System Growth Stages   |
|----      |-----|
|  Aim     | Define the growth stage of a building system (agile prototype)  |
| Tools    | Pen and paper / computational design |
| Case     | Building System (for focus area) |
| Groups   | Building groups (1 x building group = 4 x system groups) |
| Practice | In class activity in week 5 and 6 |
| Output   | Final spec for the system including the standardized development stages |
| Submit   | Markdown file |

Based on this we can then design the bulding system as a reconfigurable 'agile prototype' that we can integrate with other systems to adapt to different project requirements.

### Agile Protoype
This does *not mean* that the constructed prototype has to adapt like a transformer...

![transformer image](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/thumb/d/dc/OpTransformsSu.jpg/400px-OpTransformsSu.jpg) &nbsp;

but that **the design of the agile prototype can** using [Computational and Parametric Design] techniques described in this course.

To acheive this, we will operate on different [building systems](/Agile/Systems/).
### This year

Your agile prototype needs to be able to: take a building:

* The designs from the Advanced Building Design Course (41936)
<!--* The model for the Skylab building on campus.-->

# A3 Analyse
![METHOD_03](https://github.com/timmcginley/Agile-Prototyping/assets/1415855/ed16a76b-d6c3-4697-9a1e-f1fdd5cb361d)

>Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Pastcasting with the purpose of revealing biases.

In this part you will:
* Identify the genes of existing systems.
* continuing with the design science research methodology (DSRM) in this stage you will get to design and develop soutions to address the requirements you identifeid in [A2] 

This assignment results in the production of your [Agile Prototype](/Agile/Concepts/AgilePrototype)(s). This involves a number of stages.

## 3.1 AP identify Design Genes

For each of your system [requirements] from [A2].1 :

* Address the gaps from the [AFDP] (AFDP_01) description.
* 

We have expanded out this assingnment to give you the maximum time possible to play in it as we see that this is the 'funnest' part.


7. **PASTCASTING** / AGILE PROTOTYPE: Focus on the modelling of the agile Prototype using biodigital prototyping methods.


9. This applies the concepts of biological development to inform the development of our agile biodigtal prototype.
- This follows the design and development and demonstration stages of DSRM.

### Learning Objectives
3. [Reverse engineer](/Agile/Concepts/ReverseEngineer) the pseudo biological developmental stages of the system based on the identified features to transform the building system or product into an ‘Agile Prototype' (AP).
5. Model and traverse a phylogenetic tree of the features of AP to identify new solutions.
6. Apply computational modelling techniques to model the evolution of the AP.
7. Extrapolate the future features of the AP based on its evolution.

### Assignment
Exercise(s)
Identify an artefact or system that we are familiar with today. Reverse it in pseudo developmental stages…
Example: 
MorphoPrototyping:
1.	Identify an artefact or system.
2.	Identify the ‘features’ of that artefact or system
3.	Imagine that the artefact ‘developed’ as if it were a biological organism
4.	Identify when the artefact ‘expressed’ these features by working out pseudo developmental stages for the artefact.
5.	Imagine there are genes that trigger the expression of the features.

6.	Reverse engineer the features (genes) and pseudo developmental stages of the agile prototype (building system or product).

### Details
This assignment should include:
*	The problem you have identified
*	The ‘prototype’ that you have identified (the system / artefact)
*	Its pseudo developmental features and stages.
*	The features of the system you have identified.
*	How far back into the past you have gone (twice as far as you forecast).
*	A conceptual model showing how the object has been defined over time.

This should be an A4 report containing the sections above. The length is up to you but clarity is favoured over length.
