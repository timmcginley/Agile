>Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Pastcasting with the purpose of revealing biases.

In this part you will:
* Identify the requirements and features of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Extend traditional requirements engineering concepts to include [meta disciplinary analysis] of a selected building system.
* This stage introduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that you can define your solution objectives, based on your problem identification process in the previous stage.

This assignment results in the production of your [Agile Prototype](/Agile/Concepts/AgilePrototype)(s). This involves a number of stages.

## 3.1 xxx identify xxx
For each of your [requirements] from [A2] :

* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_01) description.

We have expanded out this assingnment to give you the maximum time possible to play in it as we see that this is the 'funnest' part.


7. **PASTCASTING** / AGILE PROTOTYPE: Focus on the modelling of the agile Prototype using biodigital prototyping methods.


9. This applies the concepts of biological development to inform the development of our agile biodigtal prototype.
- This follows the design and development and demonstration stages of DSRM.

### Learning Objectives
3. [Reverse engineer](/Agile/Concepts/ReverseEngineer) the pseudo biological developmental stages of the system based on the identified features to transform the building system or product into an ‘Agile Prototype' (AP).
5. Model and traverse a phylogenetic tree of the features of AP to identify new solutions.
6. Apply computational modelling techniques to model the evolution of the AP.
7. Extrapolate the future features of the AP based on its evolution.

### Assignment
Exercise(s)
Identify an artefact or system that we are familiar with today. Reverse it in pseudo developmental stages…
Example: 
MorphoPrototyping:
1.	Identify an artefact or system.
2.	Identify the ‘features’ of that artefact or system
3.	Imagine that the artefact ‘developed’ as if it were a biological organism
4.	Identify when the artefact ‘expressed’ these features by working out pseudo developmental stages for the artefact.
5.	Imagine there are genes that trigger the expression of the features.

6.	Reverse engineer the features (genes) and pseudo developmental stages of the agile prototype (building system or product).

### Details
This assignment should include:
*	The problem you have identified
*	The ‘prototype’ that you have identified (the system / artefact)
*	Its pseudo developmental features and stages.
*	The features of the system you have identified.
*	How far back into the past you have gone (twice as far as you forecast).
*	A conceptual model showing how the object has been defined over time.

This should be an A4 report containing the sections above. The length is up to you but clarity is favoured over length.
