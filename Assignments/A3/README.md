# A3 Analyse
![METHOD_03](https://github.com/timmcginley/Agile-Prototyping/assets/1415855/ed16a76b-d6c3-4697-9a1e-f1fdd5cb361d)


### Learning Objectives
3. [Reverse engineer](/41934/Concepts/ReverseEngineer) the pseudo biological developmental stages of the system based on the identified features to transform the building system or product into an ‘Agile Prototype' (AP).
5. Model and traverse a phylogenetic tree of the features of AP to identify new solutions.
6. Apply computational modelling techniques to model the evolution of the AP.
7. Extrapolate the future features of the AP based on its evolution.

Exercise(s)
Identify an artefact or system that we are familiar with today. Reverse it in pseudo developmental stages…
Example: 
MorphoPrototyping:
1.	Identify an artefact or system.
2.	Identify the ‘features’ of that artefact or system
3.	Imagine that the artefact ‘developed’ as if it were a biological organism
4.	Identify when the artefact ‘expressed’ these features by working out pseudo developmental stages for the artefact.
5.	Imagine there are genes that trigger the expression of the features.
Assignment
This assignment should include:
•	The problem you have identified
•	The ‘prototype’ that you have identified (the system / artefact)
•	Its pseudo developmental features and stages.
•	The features of the system you have identified.
•	How far back into the past you have gone (twice as far as you forecast).
•	A conceptual model showing how the object has been defined over time.
This should be an A4 report containing the sections above. The length is up to you but clarity is favoured over length.
