## A1 - How to Grow a Tent, Bench, or Desk?

|          |  How to Grow a Prototype   |
|----      |-----|
| Aim      | Learn Agile Prototyping Methods with a simple example  |
| Tools    | Pen and paper|
| Case     | Tent, Bench, or Desk |
| Groups   | (Group) 4 - 6 People |
| Practice | In class activity in week 1-4|
| Output   | Drawings & Models |
| Submit   | Documented process, Digital drawings or photos / scans of physical drawings |

In this assignment you will follow the Agile Prototyping Method on your chosen prototype in the following steps:

Follow the in class steps and submit:

1. Your identified prototype features and growth stages.
2. Your identified prototype functions.
3. Your future prototype (reversed engineered)
4. Your identified needs.
5. Your 'How to grow a prototype' process
    1. Documenting your weeks, process and morphogenetic stages throughout.
6. Your drawings.

Scanned / photographed and submitted on DTU Learn by Sunday September 28.

<!-- ### 1. Identify the functions
* Define the functions of a cup
* What features of a cup support these functions?

### 2. Ide

### 2. Feature variables
* Imagine a universal cup designing system;
  * The system could design any cup.
  * How would the features for different cups
  * What variables would these features have?
  * Could you define the range of the variables that could support any cup?
 
### 3. Out of order?
* Thinking procedurally, in what order would we apply those functions to the design?
* Can we find a universal 'pseudo' developmental sequence for any cup?
* Which feature would happen first?

### 4. Is is growing?
* Could we consider these functional variables to be a bit like the suppression and expression of genes in a growing organism?

# A1 Future
![METHOD_01](https://github.com/timmcginley/Agile-Prototyping/assets/1415855/ac03d956-ba92-4f61-8026-1a3a81bf6086)

This part identifies the near, medium and long term future that will provide the future context of your groups agile prototype. Introduce Agile Principles and Processes
Identify artefact or system from contexts and its 'features'.

Detail:
* Define your [future design experience]
* Define your building sytem for your group - individually gather the challenges to this system and hwo you will support your group.

All work should be compiled into a single [markdown] document. This can be directly submitted on Learn, or better you could share a link to your groups own github repository. Please see this link on the parallel advnaced BIM course for information about using [github].

## Submission Details

A markDown File (called A1-Team-XX) that includes:

1. At least one paragraph for each future near mid and far (you will use these to generate needs in [A2])
1. A timeline diagram that tells us the year of the 3 futures
1. System selection
1. [Gene] System focus with justification
1. Project Selection and justification
1. Planet A or B focus wiht justification.


## Learning Objectives
1. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
8. Define the three horizons of a future scenario and explore the future of the AP.
