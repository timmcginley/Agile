In this assignment you will:

## A2 - Building Systems Features

## A3 - Building Systems Features

<!--

## A1 - Future
In this part you will:
* Envision a system that enables 'instant buildings'.
* Select a specific [gene system] to focus on.
* Explore the implications of instant buildings for different stakaholders.
* identify the near, medium and long term future that will provide the future context of your group's agile prototype.


## A2 - Needs
In this part you will:
* identify the requirements of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Introduce Agile Principles and Processes

## A3 - Analyse
In this part you will:
* Select a [gene system] to focus on.
* Identify artefact or system from contexts and its 'features'.
* ['Reverse engineer'] the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## A4 - Change
In this part you will:
* Develop or 
* Make a change to a system in an existing building model using a tool that you have developed
* Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios.
* Is your agile prototype aligned?
* if not can you align it?
