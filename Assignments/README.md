## A1 - The Cup

|       |  How to grow a cup   |
|----   |-----|
|  Aim  |   Run through agile prototyping methods with a simple example  |
| Tools | Pen and paper|
| Case | Cup |
| Practice | In class activity in week 1 and 2|
| Output | Drawings|
| Submit | Digital drawings or photos / scans of physical drawings |

In this assignment you will:
* Define the functions of a cup
* Imagine a universal cup designing system;
  * for different cups what variables would these functions need?
  * Could you define the range of the variables - to support any cup?
* Thinking procedurally, in what order would we apply those functions to the design?
* Can we find a universal 'pseudo' developmental sequence for any cup?
* Could we consider these functional variables to be a bit like the suppression and expression of genes in a growing organism?

## A2 - Building Systems Features

## A3 - Building Systems Features

[project]: /Agile/Projects
['Reverse engineer']: /Agile/Concepts/ReverseEngineer
[gene system]: /Agile/Concepts/Genes

<!--

## A1 - Future
In this part you will:
* Envision a system that enables 'instant buildings'.
* Select a specific [gene system] to focus on.
* Explore the implications of instant buildings for different stakaholders.
* identify the near, medium and long term future that will provide the future context of your group's agile prototype.


## A2 - Needs
In this part you will:
* identify the requirements of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Introduce Agile Principles and Processes

## A3 - Analyse
In this part you will:
* Select a [gene system] to focus on.
* Identify artefact or system from contexts and its 'features'.
* ['Reverse engineer'] the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## A4 - Change
In this part you will:
* Develop or 
* Make a change to a system in an existing building model using a tool that you have developed
* Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios.
* Is your agile prototype aligned?
* if not can you align it?
