# Assignments

## A1 - Future Forecast
### Learning Objectives
1. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
8. Define the three horizons of a future scenario and explore the future of the AP.

Detail:
* Define your [future design experience] (individual)
* Define your building sytem for your group - individually gather the challenges to this system and hwo you will support your group.

All work should be compiled into a single [markdown] document. This can be directly submitted on Learn, or better you could share a link to your groups own github repository. Please see this link on the parallel advnaced BIM course for information about using [github].

## A2 - Needs Backcast
### Learning Objectives
3. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.

## A3 - Analyse *PastCast*
### Learning Objectives
3. [Reverse engineer] the pseudo biological developmental stages of the system based on the identified features to transform the building system or product into an ‘Agile Prototype' (AP).
5. Model and traverse a phylogenetic tree of the features of AP to identify new solutions.
6. Apply computational modelling techniques to model the evolution of the AP.
7. Extrapolate the future features of the AP based on its evolution.

## A4 - Change *Recast*
### Learning Objectives
7. Reflect on the APs genetic future trajectory.
9. Adapt the AP to the three horizons of the future scenario. (and the projects)
10. Define an agile roadmap for the AP to solve the identified problem.

## A5 - Final project
11. Evaluate their proposed AP.


13. Reflect on the process of developing the AP and communicate this for current and future students.
