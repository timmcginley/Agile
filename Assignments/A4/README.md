## Assignment Details

This course is backwards.

Starting with finished designs, we work togther to reverse engineer them. 

This is difficult so we use biological concepts to mediate the complexity. 

In the previous assignment you used the Agile Prototyping method to design parametric building systems that could adapt to different projects. We call these parametric systems 'Agile Prototypes' or APs for short.

In this assignment we work out how to integrate the developmental satges and functions of different APs into a multi disciplinary building growth staging method.

This should enable us to 'grow a building'.

However as noone has ever grown a building before we suggest three projects that would help you explore this idea. Please remember in this assignment, it is more important that you are exploring the idea and seeing where it takes you, than that it is correct.

You have time later to make it right, now you just need to make it.

- **RECASTING** / CHANGE:  Compute future vectors.
In this assignment we will be looking at the application of your AP. The assignment is open, meaning it is up to you to define how you see your AP being applied.
Some examples of what you could consider:

- How will the users interact with it?
- Will any user behaviour need to change, or will the AP change to the users needs?
- What is the link between your prototype and a full scale solution?
- What potential issues will your AP create in the future?

If you feel you have already covered this in A3, you are also free to continue to develop your solution based on the feedback from A3.
