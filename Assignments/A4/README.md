- **RECASTING** / CHANGE:  Model the history (evolution) of the prototype and use this to determine the prototype’s current future trajectory.
- This happens by applying the biological concept of evolutionary development to the
‘Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of recasting with the purpose of evoking imagination and in our case imagining the future trajectory of building system features based on their current ‘genes’ identified in assignment 2 and future needs.
- This follows the evaluate and communicate steps of the DSRM.

### Learning Objectives
7. Reflect on the APs genetic future trajectory.
9. Adapt the AP to the three horizons of the future scenario. (and the projects)
10. Define an agile roadmap for the AP to solve the identified problem.
