- **RECASTING** / CHANGE:  Compute future vectors.
In this assignment we will be looking at the application of your AP. The assignment is open, meaning it is up to you to define how you see your AP being applied.
Some examples of what you could consider:

- How will the users interact with it?
- Will any user behaviour need to change, or will the AP change to the users needs?
- What is the link between your prototype and a full scale solution?
- What potential issues will your AP create in the future?

If you feel you have already covered this in A3, you are also free to continue to develop your solution based on the feedback from A3.
