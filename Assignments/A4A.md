## Assignment Details
**Part 1: Model and Build the prototype** 

* Describe and design how priorities shift (if at all) between the terrestrial building (A2-A3) and the space station deployment for your system
* Design and model your space within the prototype to demonstrate the key stages and features identified in your A3 preliminary design
* Create a drawing or diagram showing the spatial connections, interfaces, and interactions between your system and at least two other group systems within the space station
* Integrate your physical prototype into the shared hyper space tent installation, ensuring it connects and interacts logically with systems designed by other groups, describing how you have done so
* Document how your system adapts to the unique constraints and opportunities of the low orbit space station environment.
* Describe your model, your space, and your systems within it

**Part 2: Draw the Growth table of your space (eg, living room, control room) based on your system (eg, roof)** 
* Draw the Growth table ( stages, functions, features, etc)
* Describe the functional and spatial requirements at each stage
* Document the dependencies on other systems, their growth stages and how that connects
* Consider how these elements can be apply to a ‘real building’ back on earth






<!-- Assignment 2024
This course is backwards.

Starting with finished designs, we work togther to reverse engineer them. This is difficult so we use biological concepts to mediate the complexity. In the previous assignment you used the Agile Prototyping method to design parametric building systems that could adapt to different projects. We call these parametric systems 'Agile Prototypes' or APs for short.

In this assignment we want you (in your building groups) to work out how to integrate the developmental satges and functions of different APs into a multi disciplinary building growth staging method. This should enable us to 'grow a building'.

However as noone has ever grown a building before we suggest three projects that would help you explore this idea. Please remember in this assignment, it is more important that you are exploring the idea and seeing where it takes you, than that it is correct.

You have time later to make it right, now you just need to make it.

- **RECASTING** / CHANGE:  Compute future vectors.
In this assignment we will be looking at the application of your AP. The assignment is open, meaning it is up to you to define how you see your AP being applied.
Some examples of what you could consider:

- How will the users interact with it?
- Will any user behaviour need to change, or will the AP change to the users needs?
- What is the link between your prototype and a full scale solution?
- What potential issues will your AP create in the future?

If you feel you have already covered this in A3, you are also free to continue to develop your solution based on the feedback from A3.
