<!--
In this final assignment you will give a class presentation where you give an outline of:
1. Your futures + gaps (A1)
2. Requirements + Genes (A2)
3. Your solution + tests/methodology (A3)
4. Your reflections (A4)

You don't have to hand in your presentation, but you will be given an assignment (passive feedback) during the presentation, which you have to hand in (this will be presented at the beginning of the presentation day).
