## A2 - Building System Needs

|          |  Building Systems Features   |
|----      |-----|
|  Aim     |   Define the features of a building system (agile prototype)  |
| Tools    | Pen and paper / computational design |
| Case     | Building System (for focus area) |
| Groups   | Same group as A1 (2 to 3 people) |
| Practice | In class activity in week 3 and 4 |
| Output   | Drawings / digital prototypes (i.e. grasshopper) |
| Submit   | Markdown file + final drawing demonstrating completion of AP1 (including 'line', 'segments' and 'features') |

## Assignment

* Complete [AP1] steps for your selected [building system]
* As disciplinary experts in your selected system we expect you to be able to go further than you managed in the first assingment with cup.
* Once you have completed your first iteration of [AP1] for your selected [system], you should apply it to the 'real' building example. This will help you to identify the features that we might expect to see in each segment. You can also note the functions, but please keep them seperate. In this case we identify the features so that we can reverse engineer the functions in the staging process in the next assignment [A3].
* Now adapt your line, segment and feature diagram so that it works also works in the case of the provided building.
* This adapted final line, segment and feature drawing is the one that you should submit.

>Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Backcasting with the purpose of supporting the codesign of solutions.

In this part you will:
* Identify the requirements and features of the future product / system in your defined future(s).
* Extend traditional requirements engineering concepts to include [meta disciplinary analysis] of a selected building system.
* This stage introduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that you can define your solution objectives, based on your problem identification process in the previous stage.

This assignment results in the production of the [Agile Future Design Plan] (AFDP). This involves a number of stages.

## 2.1 AFDP_01 identify *Future Gaps*
for each of your [futures] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_01) description.
  
## 2.2 AFDP_02 Define *System Requirements*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_02) description.
  
## 2.3 AFDP_03 Define *System Features*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_03) description.
  
## 2.4 AFDP_04 Identify *System Examples*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_04) description.

## 2.5 AFDP_05 Identify *System Analysis*
for each of your selected [gene systems] from [A1]:
* Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_05) description.
  
## 2.6 AFDP_06 Create a *Future Case*
Address the points from the [AFDP] (AFDP_05) description in a 1 page [science fiction prototype] that describes one of your Futures and how the feature(s) satisfy the requirement(s) you have identified for that future.

## Submission Details
Simple report docuementing the five AFDP stages in [Markdown] format (called A1-Team-XX). If doing it [Github], please remember to make the repository public so we can give your feedback. You are also welcome to upload it to Learn if you prefer.

## Learning Objectives
3. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
4. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
