# Science Fiction Prototyping Example

The abstract for the whole paper is here..

>The architectural singularity is approaching. It is the point at which buildings become more intelligent than their occupants and designers. This will significantly change the roles of the built-environment professions in the design, fabrication, construction and operation of buildings. By exploring self-organizing behaviour in biological development this article describes the approaching challenges of this architectural singularity. Elements of morphogenetic design have been applied in various disciplines associated with intelligent building (IB), including architecture, engineering and computing. However, these previous discipline-specific approaches have not considered the trans-disciplinary implications of morphogenetic growth processes on the role of the disciplines associated with IB. Therefore, this article introduces a science fiction prototyping (SFP) scenario that proposes a morphogenetic design process for IBs based on Drosophila melanogaster development and grounded in the contemporary technologies of Building Information Modelling, digital fabrication and parametric design. Based on a discussion of the implications for the design team a morphogenetic architecture framework for IB is proposed.

>Its 21:35 and Kai is the only one left in the office. There’s a rush on, Kai’s firm is doing 47 stores across the US in the next two weeks and the design work has not started. The crazy thing is Kai doesn’t even know what the store is selling! The bosses won the contract by saying they’d have a mod look at it and promised BDS 4 by the end of the week! To them the returns look great and to an outsider it’s so fast, but they’ve got no idea what’s involved. All they know is that they’ve sponsored Kai’s implants and want to make sure she [draws fast].

>Drawing using a mod may be fast, but it hurts . . . In recruitment mod drawing is described to freshheads as a game, kind of like the old guitar hero Kai’s dad used to play, but rather than Slayer it’s the emotional intention of hundreds of full res user ghosts screaming in your head whilst you try and decide which [designGenes] to trigger with each division. No division, no level progression and no growth. The typological template needs to hit BDS 3 first thing tomorrow for the engineers to sign off.

>Coffee made, Kai jacks in and can see the blastoderm on site as a glowing oblong of noise. Kai rotates it to align with the murmurs of the voices on the site. Primary axes set, they shift phase to form planes that slice the egg to inform the openings in the blastoderm. It burns the sensation of the sun, wind and snow on its skin and highlights segments that might adapt and protect itself accordingly.
>
>Several distinct voices become apparent over the murmurs . . . at first a few curious visitors and then without warning the experiences of a thousand users of similar buildings are flash loaded into the buildings developing conscious. On the brink of nightmares and nervous fragmentation, Kai steers the cellular differentiation of the building as it tries to accommodate the desires of so many people. Along the pathways of previous experience, the building furrows crevices to form its multi dorsal network of neural crest sections. BDS 1 … Its newly formed sense of itself and the [cold of the outside] make it scream but Kai is used to it. The site is pure noise now; Kai squints and adjusts the frequency of the view. Through the noise, it is possible to see the muscle celled skins grow and flex around iridescent insides to form a body guard’s attachment to the simulated life and desires of the ghosts. This building is an army to live in, a light to bathe in and a friend to come home to, at a junction between our perception of the natural and artificial worlds, fused together by morphogenetic processes, the system represents an inhumanly natural approach, an architectural ultra-nature.

>The template is set …

>Pause. Kai sips her coffee and gets up from her chair. The engineers will be running simulations in the back of her head over night, its two minutes to midnight and she needs to get some sleep. The program was stopped at BDS 2, the template can now be transplanted onto any [site] . . . She always hopes that this time the building won’t move when it wakes up . . . There’s always a couple of minutes just before its first breath when she can imagine that this time she’s done it and [carved] the perfect design . . . Just a couple more stages and the materiality would be set, the raw nerves of its skin would be sealed in cool amorphous, bio artificial alloys through the coalescing and corrugation of the blastoderm into the dorsal shield, glistening in the moon light awaiting the feeling of the first rays of the sun on its new skin and she would see.
>
>That’s the bit she enjoys most . . . It distracts her from the current fashion to render antiquated modules and sheet sizes into pure surfaces which drives her crazy. Kai spent all day trying to develop a new [glass] prototype that didn’t look fake. Through the mod she can grow perfect homeostatic vasculature adaptable conditioning (HVAC) systems for the building but the contemporary architectural preoccupation of style over content masks the beauty of the morphogenetic processes which sculpt the internal systems. People don’t talk about the architectural singularity so much these days but Kai can feel its cold reality fused in her brain; it creates buildings that have more in common with their past than her future. In an age where we can do anything, to be restricted to allusions of archaic construction and maintenance techniques, is such an inefficient way to build. She can’t wait for the buildings to realise.
