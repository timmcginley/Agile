# Agile X Pavilion (2016)

This was the result fo three workshops to develop the Agile Prototyping Methodology we use in this course.

1. This was the result of the original [Agile Fab workshop](https://morphotype.wordpress.com/2015/11/22/agile-fab-nl-2015/) held at TU Delft in 2015. It was a collaboration between students from Hyperbody Research Group (TU Delft) And Architecture students from University of South Australia and Beijing Jiaotong University.
2. We then ran another workshop to define a pavilion for Adelaide <https://morphotype.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/agile-x2/>
