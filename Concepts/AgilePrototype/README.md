# Agile Prototype

>An Agile Prototype is a 'hot' replaceable design system that can integrate with other systems to create a 'complete' design. Agile Prototypes have different development stages. They operate within specific [gene system spaces]

Agile Prototypes therefore need to be:
* [Isomorphic](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Systems_Theory/Isomorphic_Systems)
* Clearly Bounded
* Transportable
* Replaceable
* Every AP should fit into one of the 8 [gene system spaces]
* The prototype is then
* Decoupled from other systems

Then the Agile Prototyping Architecture is responsible for enabling the recomposition of the Agile Prototypes. One challenge of recomposition is what happens to the system if; the *agile prototype* informing that [gene space] is removed from the project?

The approach developed in this course is to follow the process described in the [Methodology](/Agile/Methodology) section and [Morphogenetic Prototyping](/Agile/Concepts/MorphogeneticPrototyping) concept.
