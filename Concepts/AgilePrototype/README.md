# Agile Prototype

>An Agile Prototype is a 'hot' replaceable design system that can integrate with other systems to create a 'complete' design. Agile Prototypes have different development stages. They operate within specific [gene system spaces]

Agile Prototypes (AP)s therefore need to be:
* [Isomorphic](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Systems_Theory/Isomorphic_Systems)
* Clearly Bounded
* Transportable
* Replaceable
* Every AP is a specific [building system]
* Every AP should have its own set of clearly defined growth stages.
* Each AP stage should be responsive to specific [genes] the AP should function if the gene is present and or triggered or not.
* Can be non lethally decoupled from other APs.
* Each AP should have access to a record of its own performance in different building projects.

# Carving
Having created standardised modularised Agile Prototypes, to realise the potential gain in design speed and flexibility a new building discipline is required to compile and integrate APs for diffferent Building Systems. This new discipline is called [carving]. They work in parallel wiht [coders] which are responsible for encoding, maintaining and sequencing the APs genes. 

One challenge of recomposition is what happens to the system if; the *agile prototype* informing that [gene space] is removed from the project? It is important that the AP can adopt a non lethal configuration if its genes are inaccesible or become curropted (fail gracefully).

The approach developed in this course is to follow the process described in the [Methodology](/Agile/Methodology) section.
