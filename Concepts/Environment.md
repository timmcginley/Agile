# Environment

This is used here in relation to the proposed equation to calculate the [genotype].

First we need to define the local environment and help us to search a solution space to identify solutions from similar climates we do this using a [climate classification] system.

In this course we use the KÃ¶ppen climate classification ([KCC]).
