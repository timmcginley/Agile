# Agile

> In response to an increase in the control of project managers and creativity crippling documentation requirements in software development at the turn of the 21st century, programmers developed a series of methodologies which were united under the manifesto of agile software development (Beck et al. 2001). The story of the development of Agile is well documented as are the techniques to employ it (Martin 2003). Agile is often compared to the more traditional ‘waterfall’ model (figure 2) wherein each of the main tasks are completed sequentially and are all planned up front. In Agile development, the design progresses in sprints and the tasks are reviewed on a daily basis. These ideas were incorporated in the four values of the Agile Software Development Manifesto (Beck et al. 2001)

2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

>Agile development covers a range of approaches including, XP (extreme program-ming), Scrum, (Erickson et al. 2005) as well as others. Droste (2010) describesa process of applying agile development methodologies from computer science inarchitecture. The limitation of Droste is that it focusses on XP rather than morebroadly on the principles of Agile development. This is important because there ismuch discussion in computer science about the most appropriate method of agiledevelopment. Therefore this paper focuses on the principles of agile developmentrather than a particular methodology.The principles are summarised here as:
>1. Satisfy clients by early and continuousdelivery of valuable designs
>1. Welcome changing requirements, even in latedevelopment
>1. Deliver working designs frequently
>1. Facilitate close, dailycooperation between stakeholders and designers
>1. Build projects around mo-tivated individuals, and trust them
>1. Encourage face-to-face conversation asthe best form of communication (co-location)
>1. Measure progress on workingdesign systems
>1. Maintain a constant sustainable pace (avoid burn out)
>1. Focus on technical excellence and good design
>1. Maximise the amount of worknot done
>1. Support teams to self-organise
>1. Reflect continuously on howto become more effective and adjust behaviour accordingly.
