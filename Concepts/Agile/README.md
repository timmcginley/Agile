# Agile

> In response to an increase in the control of project managers and creativity crippling documentation requirements in software development at the turn of the 21st century, programmers developed a series of methodologies which were united under the manifesto of agile software development [(Beck et al. 2001)]. The story of the development of Agile is well documented as are the techniques to employ it (Martin 2003). Agile is often compared to the more traditional ‘waterfall’ model (figure 2) wherein each of the main tasks are completed sequentially and are all planned up front. In Agile development, the design progresses in sprints and the tasks are reviewed on a daily basis. These ideas were incorporated in the four values of the Agile Software Development Manifesto [(Beck et al. 2001)].

Agile development covers a range of approaches including, XP [(extreme programming)], Scrum, (Erickson et al. 2005) as well as others. Droste (2010) describes a process of applying agile development methodologies from computer science inarchitecture. The limitation of Droste is that it focusses on XP rather than more broadly on the principles of Agile development. This is important because there is much discussion in computer science about the most appropriate method of agile development. Therefore this course follows the principles of agile prototyping [(McGinley et. al. 2017)]. The principles are summarised here as:

### 1. Maintain a constant sustainable pace (avoid burn out)
It is necessary to takefrequent breaks and adjust project constraints and load if required in order to main-tain the health of the team.
### 2. Encourage face-to-face conversation and colocation wherever possible and fa-cilitate close, daily cooperation between stakeholders and designers. 
Barriers to collaboration and communication should be reduced.
### 3. Build projects around motivated individuals, trust and support them to selforganize. 
Encourage and support flat hierarchies where in tutors and participantsare on the same team - learning and solving problems together. The flat hierarchymeans that any participant can suggest changes to both the design work and thefacilitation of the workshop at any point.
### 4. Satisfy clients by early and continuous and frequent delivery of valuable designs. 
An aim for agile design systems for architecture is to have parallel systemsand that we can meaningfully involve the client early in the design process. Agile focusses on using technology to support collaboration with clients. In this wayit is the collaboration and the constant testing and exploration of the design toolsthat enable the design to progress.
### 5. Maximise the amount of work not done and measure progress on working interoperable design systems.
This does not mean that everyone needs to be an expert, but some do. This should not be confused with reducing the exploration of the opportunity space, but focus on minimizing redundancy in the exploration.
### 6. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. 
Close collaboration with the clients is not sustainable without high value design solutions to offer.To support this, it is important that the design systems are not only interoperablebut can be reconfigured to support alternative design systems.
### 7. Focus on technical excellence and good design whilst reflecting continuouslyon how to become more effective and adjust behaviour accordingly. 
This provides an opportunity to capture and reuse valuable design tools and processesto extend exploration of the opportunity space and focus on how to do things betternext time.
