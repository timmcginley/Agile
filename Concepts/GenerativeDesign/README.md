# Generative Design

This course course considers the idea of Generative Design to trying to develop building designs 'from nothing'. This approach is not taken in this course as we believe that it is left over from previous 'starting from scratch' / 'blank page' metaphors which shile popular in consulting, wastefully ignore the lessons learnt and systems developed from previous buildings.

There is a rich history of these approaches stretching back to the early [Architecture Machine] experiments.
