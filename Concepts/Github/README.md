# Github

>Really this concept should be called Git, Github is just a convenient platform that makes it easier to use apply teh git protocols to version control your projects.

Github solves the problem of having to learn git commands in the [command line] which can be daunting at the start. It enables us to 'version control our documents and projects (up to 100mb). So we wouldn't use it for raw BIM data but it is great for sharing your code and tools with others and supporting collaboration.

To further test its possibilities we use it in this course to host all our course documentation.

Get a github account, (at least one per team), this will make it possible to host your code on the github and make it easier for us to provide you support and also get feedback and help from your peers. Ultimately we are trying to build a strong community or OpenBIM learning at DTU and this is a great way to do it ðŸ˜Š
