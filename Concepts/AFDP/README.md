# Agile Future Design Plan (AFDP)

The AFDP is a core document of the Agile Prototyping Methodology. It follows on from the Design Gene Identification (DGIP) stage followed in [Assignment 1]. AN AFDP has four sections:

* Future Gaps
* System Requirements
* System Features
* Future Case

questions:

* where do the genes come in?
* what is novel?
* how can we test it?

## AFDP_01 
* Defines the future gap(s), these are the things that do not exist today in the building industry that we need to meet or avoid your speculative future(s).
* what do we need to design / invent/ improve/ stop / discover or start to adapt to each of the Futures. please present the gaps for each.
* this will form the basis of your agile future development plan (AFDP). this should cover your selected gene systems from [A1].
  
## AFDP_02 Defines the System Requirements 
for each of your selected [gene systems]:
* define the environmental impacts.
* remember gene = environment + phenotypic.
* How do these requirements change over your stated futures?
* Identify the
  
## AFDP_03 Proposes System Features
* Speculate features your prototype gene system could to address the requirements. when would these features be needed.
* provide a timeline for the development of each of the features and include this in your AFDP.
* This can include both product and design system features.

## AFDP_04 Define System Examples
* Identify specific products or systems that exist today that could be adapted to address the identified gaps and develop teh rewquiremetns to meet the required features.
* This could be more than one product or system that you imagine will synthesis into a hyrbid solution in your future(s).

## AFDP_ 05 Define a Science Fiction Prototype for the features
* A future case is a 'use case' set in a speculative future.
* We can use techniques sucha as [science fiction prototype] to describe one of your Futures and how the feature(s) satisfy the requirement(s) you have idenitified for that future.
* Provides either a hard or soft science fiction prototype, that defines the vision for the future case(s).
* Produce a 1 page narrative that des
* This is a creative exercise it should be grounded in the thinking you have developed in the rest of the exercise.

### Learning Objectives
3. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
4. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
