# Computational Design

Computational Design also sometimes called Parametric Design, is an essential ingredient of Agile Prototyping.

To support this, 6 computational design exercises are provided here.

This will involve some visual programming most probably in [Grasshopper] and utilising the analysis tools in [BOHM] and then linking it all together in [Speckle].
