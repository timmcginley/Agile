# Future Design Experience

We normally talk about the user experience, which as designers and engineers working in the built environment is very important.

User experience typically also refers to our own experience of using design tools, however it is necessary to make a distinction between passive tool use, and creative design experience.

To support this we define the design experience as a unique experience and the future design experience as a space to explore the aspirations of future designers.


## Prompt questions
* What would you like your future design experience to be like?
* How would technology augment this experience?
* Is it important for the technology to be invisible or expressed?
* How would you promote your individual skills and competences with your future design experience?
* Do you imagine yourself sitting at a desk?
* Would you be in an office?
