This extends the tradtional scope of [buildings] and [building systems] to include products in buildings. It argues that buildings are a [platform] for products and that there are lots of opportunities for service integration.

Obviously it also can be read that buildings are products and building systems are also products as well as services.

Whilst this course deals mainly with building systems the aim is to extend it include all products which are platformed by buildings.
