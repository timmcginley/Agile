# Singularity

A concept proposed by Ray Kurzweil who claimed that by 2045, we can increase our computers will be more intelligent than humans. This paper proposes that, whatever the date, at some point the idea of an ‘architectural singularity’ wherein buildings will be more intelligent than people – will have big implications for the role of the human design team. The paper proposes a science fiction prototyping scenario to explore the role of an architectural intern after the ‘architectural’ singularity.
