# Features

It is easy when starting to confuse features and functions. Features are things that we can observe, we can measure them, we mgiht be able to test their performance. This is great for reverse engineering physical systems that we do not yet understand. It is also good to start from features when we do understand the system well but want to gain a fresh understanding of it.
