# Agile Future Design Plan (AFDP)

The AFDP is a core document of the Agile Prototyping Methodology. It follows on from the Design Gene Identification (DGIP) stage followed in [Assignment 1]. AN AFDP has FIVE sections:

1. Future Gaps
1. System Requirements
1. System Features
1. System Examples
1. System Analysis
1. Future Case

## AFDP_01 Future Gaps
* Defines the future gap(s), these are the things that do not exist today in the building industry that we need to meet or avoid your speculative future(s).
* What do we need to design / invent/ improve/ stop / discover or start to adapt to each of the Futures. Please present the gaps for each.
* How are the selected Gene Systems [A1] affected by these gaps?
  
## AFDP_02 System Requirements 
* Define the environmental impacts for the included gene system(s).
* Remember gene = environment + phenotypic - how will the environment / context changes - how will this affect the system requirements?
* How do these requirements change over your stated futures?
  
## AFDP_03 System Features
* Speculate features your prototype gene system could to address the requirements. when would these features be needed.
* provide a timeline for the development of each of the features and include this in your AFDP.
* This can include both product and design system features.

## AFDP_04 System Examples
* Identify specific products or systems that exist today that could be adapted to address the identified gaps and develop teh rewquiremetns to meet the required features.
* This could be more than one product or system that you imagine will synthesis into a hyrbid solution in your future(s).

## AFDP_05 System Analysis
* How should the gene systems you are proposing be analysed to address the future gap?
* This does not need to be super complicated - but you should consider if you will do digital, physical or hybrid testing of the systems you produce?
* You can uSe the system requirements (AFDP_06) here to help you.

## AFDP_06 Future Case
* A future case is a 'use case' set in a speculative future to define a vision for the future case(s).
* We can use techniques such as [science fiction prototype] to describe one of your Futures and how the feature(s) satisfy the requirement(s) you have idenitified for that future.
* This is a creative exercise it should be grounded in the thinking you have developed in the rest of the exercise.
* It should introduce a character that acts as the future user in your future case. Develop this persona so that it helps you to understand how you want your agile prototype to adpat to their future needs.
* It should describe the products of your selected gene systems in the future.
