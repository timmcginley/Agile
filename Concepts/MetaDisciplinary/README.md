# Meta Disciplinary Building Analysis

Metadisicplinarity solves the problem of disciplinary ownership of elements / [systems] in the [building]. Whilst there is contractual convenience to this, it makes no sense in terms of integration. A meta disciplinary approach aims to provide a single lens to view all elements in the building, to avoid more inpenetrable silos in the design process.
