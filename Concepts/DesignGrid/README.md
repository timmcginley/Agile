This has been developed over a number of years and we can now show it here. We are sharing to for inspriation, as whilst it works as an analytical framework, it does not currently help us to know how to grow a bulding or even a building system. Therefore this year we want you to tell us how you think this would happen. There are no right answers :)

## Stage 1 (Root)
In this first stage the site, height and envelope and floors are defined. 

### Site

### Height
The height is limited by the constraints of the [project]

### Envelope.
The envelope can be calculated.
