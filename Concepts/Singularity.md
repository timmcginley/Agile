>Important note: when we ask ChatGPT about the date of the singularity, it did not like to say, but rather it thought that the singularity concept was contentious and that AI will probably not be apocolyptic....

The Singularity is a concept proposed by Ray Kurzweil who claimed that by 2045, we can increase our computers will be more intelligent than humans. 
## Architectural Singularity
The ‘architectural singularity’ will occur when buildings become more intelligent than people – this will have big implications for the role of the human design team. [McGinley, (2015)] proposed a [science fiction prototyping] scenario to explore the role of an architectural intern after the ‘architectural’ singularity.
