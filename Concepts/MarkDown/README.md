# Markdown

>Here is a quote about how much we love markdown

This can also be expressed as:

$Markdown > PDF$


MarkDown solves the problem of having a standard formatted easily editable text. But the real reason we love it is that it is soooo easy :)

*That is why we prefer that all documentation and reports for this course are provided in MarkDown format.*
