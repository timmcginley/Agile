# Building

We use building because we feel it is a discipline free description of what we are talking about. Although it may feel strange for Architects to talk about 'building design' rather than architecture, the use of 'building design' helps to provide an interdisciplinary foundation for the design of buildings. It also helps all the members of the team to haev a common goal. For instance, they would all agree that they want to design a great building.
