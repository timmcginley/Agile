# Growth

## Economic growth
in the built environment we think if growth normally in terms of economy, or perhaps sustainable development.

## Personal growth
we also think of growth in terms of our educational, personal, educational and moral journey.In what ways have you grown since you started your education and what growth do you still wish to achieve?

## Biological growth
biological growth provides useful concepts for how to understand the 'developmental' growth of biological organisms.

## Building *design* as Growing
This applies building development stages (BDS) to buildings and their systems, to expand the design space.

## Building *Construction* as growing
we can also consider the physical construction of the building as growth. this would sit on the construction paradigm outlined in McGinley (2015).
