# Morphogenetic Prototyping
>Morphogenetic prototyping provides a method for designers to manipulate a design over a series of pseudo 'developmental' stages as if it had grown biologically. Designers can then manipulate the development by carving the design. Carving alludes a surfer defining a path in the water with their board. It requires an alternative design metaphor to the antiquated drawing board metaphor used in traditional digital design systems.

## Morphogenetic Protoyping Lab
In 2016 I co-founded the Morphogenetic Protootyping Lab with colleagues at UNISA in Australia.

Whilst in Denamrk I have been working on how these ideas fit into contemporary design and engineering systems.
This Agile Prototyping Course is the result of these experiments.
