# Biomimetics
Defined in ISO 18458:2105 as the 
> *'interdisciplinary cooperation of biology and technology or other fields of innovation with the goal of solving practical problems through the function analysis of biological systems, their abstraction into models, and the transfer into and application of these models to the solution'*

## Methodology
Biomimetics is integrated into the [third part (M3)] of the [Morphogenetic Protototyping] [Methodology] taught in this course.

## Strengths
* Provide access to inspiration for solutions to design and engineering problems
* Augments the traditional design process
* Encourages designers to classify and docuemtn the problem that they are trying to solve.

## Challenges
* Can be difficult to know if a solution fails was it the analogy the reference biological system or the artificial design that failed?
