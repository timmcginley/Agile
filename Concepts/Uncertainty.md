# Uncertainty

Uncertainty is a common factor when considering the future of design and engineering. So how can we work with it?

There are multiple approaches:

## Chaos Monkey
Netflix created a programme manager that deletes random services (processes) at times when the engineers can address the issue. The idea being that the software should fail gracefully, even (especially) if it is not expected.

Can you think of any examples like this from the AEC industry? We certainly see a lot of Chaos, but do we normally plan for it?
