# Evolution

This coure reframes architectural / building history as evolution. It differs in this respect with traditional '[generative design]' which would suggest that a building can be 'evolved' in a single design process from zero.

In fact the course proposes that a building should start from a seed, that includes selected genetic material from previous buildings extracted from the [phylogenetic tree] which can be used to describe the evolution of a building type.
