# Building Requirements
>Building Design and Engineering is not possible without requirements for the building. We know requirements are important, but how should we capture, store, check and maintain them?

To test the [Agile Prototypes] we develop in this course it is important that we have clearly defined requirements. This can be challenging as we are 'designing in the future'. Therfore the requirements for your project, like the futures you are designing them in, are unknowable. 
<!--- 2023 SPECIFIC - PLEASE CHAECK IN FUTURE ITERATIONS!!! -->
That is why in [A1] we have asked you to define your near, mid and far futures.

So to support this process in this course we haev asked you to describe and then 'freeze' your three futures to give you a chance to deisgn to those futures. This however runs the dahnger of reinforcing an older mindest of fixed requirements rather than using the requiremtns as a livign document that learns fom the results of the deisgn iterations to get closer to what the client 'really wants' from a sea of 'unknown unknowns' in the early stages of the design.

So the methodology we choose for our requiremetns in this course is important. ON the one hand we could choose a traditional approach susch as Requirments Engineering whihc is outlined below, but that would not help you once the 'training wheels' of this course are released and you need to manage building design requirements in real projects with uncertain futures.

Agile methodologies that inform the methodology for the course are not naturally strong on requirements engineering, therfore lets start by looking the strong requirments methodology of requirements engineering.

## Requirements Engineering (RE)
[wikipedia link]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering

Requirements Engineering frames the elicitation, analysis, modelling, specification, validation and management of design requiremetns as the focus of a design process. Some [Agile] purists may regard this as 'out of step' to the [Agile] priniciples, it is useful in our [Agile Prototyping] approach. 

### Strengths
* On the positive side it does encourage stakeholders and developers to meet,
* a focus on the requirements can indeed lead to better requirements - supporting higher quality design
* Explicitly modelling requirments in UML would support automated checking and increase the quality of automated feedback and guidance in the deisgn process (before it is too late to make changes).

### Challenges 
* REs focus on capturing static requirments fails to challenge the classical engineering mindset (tell me the problem and then shut up and let me fix it), that worked in a classical sense but is not as effective in the complex multi faceted work of 21st century deisgn and engineering.
* It does not support changes in the requirements (as much as agile does). this also means that it is more difficult for the design team to absorb each others changes and advice, reducing design integration.

 although unlike in Agile methodologies where frequent meetings are required, in Requirements Engineering the idea is to try and capture 'high quality' requirements following the acceptance of the draft requirements at the requriements validation stage. It is then not normally deemed necessary to question the requirements. 

This is similar in some ways to traditional buildign design, wherein the requirements of the client and stakeholders are captured in the initial stages of the design process and then synthesised into a design model whose engineering is then tested.

Unlike in a true [Agile] Process which appropriated elements of participatory design, the traditional building requirements disconnect the client, user, design team and stakeholders in the design process, until they have a result they would like approved by the client.



However our 'requirements engineering' approach is further complicated byt the context of 'designing in the future'.
