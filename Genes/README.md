# Building Design Genes

* The design of buildings finds it difficult to reach automation etc. becuase projects are always taken as unique. There are good reasons for this. 

* But as Architectural Engineers iwe need to find a more scientific way to understand, model, design and analyse buildings, whilst not reducing their architectural 'uniqueness'.

The diverse disciplines of the building industry make it difficult to have a singular approach.

Architectural and building science represents a dvierse collection of perspectives, that lack a common core perspective.

To address this, morphogenetic prototyping uses the lens of biology to support structured analysis of design. It is less about bio mimicry and more about imagining how a biologist how had never experienced artificial design would explain it.

This raises a number of questions, not least of which is:
1. using the lens of biology could we identify the genetic code of buildings?
2. Could we edit that code to create new improved designs?
3. having modelled the code of one buldign code we do it for older buildings, to create an evolutionary model of buildings?

we borrow the concepts of 'genes' from Biology to help. 

The metaphor of genes in design solves the problem of ... The problem is therefore how to extract the 'design' genes so we can manipulate it.

## Design Gene Extraction.

* need to extract the genes
* need a method to do this.
* pre genetic sequencing biologists used to infer genetics from measuring the 'phenotypic characteristics' of organisms.
* Morphogenetic Prototyping allows us to do the same in design.

An exciting discovery of morphogenetic Prototyping [McGinley et. al, 2016] was that the idea that

$Phenotype=Genotype+Environment$

could be rearranged to:

$Genotype=Phenotype-Environment$



## Genes
In biology genes have been described as 'expressing' at specific developmental stages. This means that instead of an explicit spatial plan, construction diagram or system. 
(Design)Genes are defined here as 
They are defined in code 
>The role of the architect in this scenario could be to both ‘write’ the designGenes and adopt Kai’s role as the ‘carver’ that triggers them to define the spatial programme, experience and materiality of the building organism.

## Agile Prototyping Gene Spaces

This will include all the genes from last year...

## So what are the genes of architectural engineering?
Previously we have left it open to you to define the focus and problem of your agile prototypes. This helped you to define your project later at thesis, however we learnt from the course feedback, that it would be helpful to reduce the options a bit :) Therefore we analysed the project choices from last year and checked based on your feedback in the recent google form. We will therefore offer nine focus areas this semester, which you can see below. There are still a lot of areas and some will be better supported than others, but we hope this reflects your diverse interests. It is also very appropriate to consider a 'major' and 'minor' in your projects. The feedback from the industry is that they want graduates that have a deep specialisation 'a major' that they can integrate with another aspect 'a minor'. An example would be the ability to perform both advanced structural and LCA analysis in a project.

|  Gene Space |  BDS1 |  BDS2 | BDS3  | BDS4  | BDS5  | BDS6  | BDS7  | BDS8  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Project | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  Location |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  External |   |   |  X |   |   |  X |   |   |
|  Function / Space |   |   | X | X |   |   |   |   |
|  Structure |   |   |   |   | X |  X |   |   |
|  Internal |   |   |   |   | X |  X |   |   |
|  Material |   |   |   |   |   | X  |   |   |
|  Build |   |   |   |   |   |   | X  |   |

## Gene Space
The rows in the table above are not chronological but could be thought of spaces or channels that flow through a project. In this way they are analagous to meta disciplinary subjects. Each gene is therefore assigned to a specific Gene Space. The *'genetic control of the system'* then determines the timing (building development stage) that the gene expresses at.

## GS1. Project
The project Gene Space contains genes that respond to the cost and time of the project. These have an influence on all the other genes in a project.

## GS2. Location
The location gene space contains genes that respond to the site and contextual decisions. These could query external data. They will also inform the extents of the boundinng conditions and inform the genes in GS3.

## GS3. Function / Space
The Gene set is the functional / space requirements. These will include genes for inividual spaces and much more.

## GS5. Structure


## GS6. Internal


## GS3. External
Includes the skin concept. Biologically it is the blastoderm.


## GS7. Material


## GS8. Build
