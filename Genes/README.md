|  Gene Space |  1 |  2 | 3  | 4  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Project |   |   |   |   |
|  Location |   |   |   |   |
|  External |   |   |   |   |
|  Function / Space |   |   |   |   |
|  Structure |   |   |   |   |
|  Internal |   |   |   |   |
|  Material |   |   |   |   |
|  Build |   |   |   |   |

The list below are not chronological but could be thought of spaces or channels that flow through a probject. In this way they are analagous to subjects in 41936.

Individual genes are expressed at a point in time in a specific gene space. and are triggered based on the stage they are assiugned to.


## GS1. Project

## GS2. Location


## GS3. External
Includes the skin concept. Biologically it is the blastoderm.


## GS4. Function / Space



## GS5. Structure


## GS6. Internal


## GS7. Material


## GS8. Build
