# Agile Prototyping Gene Spaces

An exciting discovery of morphogenetic Prototyping was that the idea that

$Phenotype=genotype+environment$

could be rearranged to:

$Genotype=phenotype-environment$

## Genes
In biology genes have been described as 'expressing' at specific developmental stages. This means that instead of an explicit spatial plan, construction diagram or system. 
(Design)Genes are defined here as 
They are defined in code 
>The role of the architect in this scenario could be to both ‘write’ the designGenes and adopt Kai’s role as the ‘carver’ that triggers them to define the spatial programme, experience and materiality of the building organism.

>McGinley, 2016



This will include all the genes from last year...

## Gene Space
The rows in the table above are not chronological but could be thought of spaces or channels that flow through a project. In this way they are analagous to meta disciplinary subjects. Each gene is therefore assigned to a specific Gene Space. The *'genetic control of the system'* then determines the timing (building development stage) that the gene expresses at.

## GS1. Project
The project Gene Space contains genes that respond to the cost and time of the project. These have an influence on all the other genes in a project.

## GS2. Location


## GS3. External
Includes the skin concept. Biologically it is the blastoderm.


## GS4. Function / Space



## GS5. Structure


## GS6. Internal


## GS7. Material


## GS8. Build
