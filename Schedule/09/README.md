## Week 9 - Design Pasts

*5th November 2024*

Generative design starts from zero, it ignores the history of previous designs. Thats crazy, its a waste of a resource of human innovation. So similar to the way we 'mine' biology for design inspiration, could we mine hitory to better understand our designs?

## Guest Lecture
* Laila Zwisler Lecture (DTU Physics)  [onsite]
* Building System History as Evolution
* Roman / Greek and Early 20thC Building Systems

## Activity
In our focus groups, we will look at 2 time periods:
1. Roman / Greek
2. Modern / Early twentieth century

In you groups you will consider:
* How do ideas from these period still affect how we design today?
* Which of these ideas are in conflict with sustainability and circularity?
* How are these ideas affected by automation and digitisation?
