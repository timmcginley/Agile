# Course Schedule

-------------------------------------
# Future *Forecast*
This part identifies the near, medium and long term future that will provide the future context of your groups agile prototype. Introduce Agile Principles and Processes
Identify artefact or system from contexts and its 'features'.

## Week 1 - Scenario / Prototyping the future
Choose a future scenario (1) metaverse wins, (2) extreme carbon and resource rationing (3) Martian building boom.
1. Plan for the course
2. Focus Areas
3. Future
4. Agile
5. Architectural Engineering
6. Previous Approaches

## Week 2 - Future Problems
identify a system that will be different from today, based on your prototyped future. What specific problems and challenges will it face?

1. Problem Identification / Themes
2. Elements / Systems
3. other thing

-------------------------------------
# Needs *Backcast*
This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

## Week 4 - Requirements
1. thing
2. document the needs

-------------------------------------
# Analyse *Pastcast*
This part 'reverse engineers' the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

# Change *Recast*
Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?
