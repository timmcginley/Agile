# Course Schedule

-------------------------------------
# Future *Forecast*
This part identifies the near, medium and long term future that will provide the future context of your groups agile prototype. Introduce Agile Principles and Processes
Identify artefact or system from contexts and its 'features'.

## Week 1 - Scenario / Prototyping the future
Choose a future scenario (1) extreme carbon and resource rationing (Planet A only) (2) Lunar building boom (Planet B only)

1. Architectural engineering in an uncertain future.
1. Focus Areas Inc. roles
2. 3 horizons framework
1. uncertainty
1. Plan for the course
2. Science Fiction Prototyping
1. Future (provide real case studies to support exercise) - mckinsey reports plus film / comics?
1. Agile Prototyping - include paper - hit all targets.
1. project targets
change 
1. Previous Approaches (pepper with)

Exercise
* Skylab tour (Digital Lab and Start Up opportunities)
* Designing in the future with Kristian Brink (present to the future)
* Choose Planet A or Planet B future.
* in class presentation of your futures

## Week 2 - Future Problems
identify a system that will be different from today, based on your prototyped future. What specific problems and challenges will it face?

1. Problem Identification / Themes
2. Testing
3. Elements / Systems
4. other thing

### Exercise
* identify the different elements / systems in a building.
* identify the system they will focus on for their future.
* Choosing a [project](/Projects).
* identify the challenges this element / system will face in the future for the chosen project in all three futures (near, mid and far).

-------------------------------------
# Needs *Backcast*
This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

## Week 3 - Meta Disciplinary
1. Meta Disciplinary framework
2. other thing

Exercise
* Identify how we might adapt our current systems to teh needs of the future scenario.

## Week 4 - Requirements
1. thing
2. document the needs

Exercise
* formalise the requirements (requirements engineering) for the four different scenarios.

-------------------------------------
# Analyse *Pastcast*
This part 'reverse engineers' the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## Week 5 - Reverse 1
1. [Biomimicry](Concepts/Biomimicry)
2. [Morphogenetic Prototyping](Concepts/MorphogeneticPrototyping)
3. [Computational Design 1](Concepts/ComputationalDesign)

## Week 6 - Reverse 2
1. thing
2. [Computational Design 2](Concepts/ComputationalDesign)

## Week 7 - Genes 1
1. thing
2.  [Computational Design 3](Concepts/ComputationalDesign)


## Week 8 - Genes 2
1. thing
2.  [Computational Design 4](Concepts/ComputationalDesign)

## Week 9 - Evolution
1. thing
2. [Computational Design 5](Concepts/ComputationalDesign)


------------------------------------
# Change *Recast*
Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?
