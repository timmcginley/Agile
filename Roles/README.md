# Roles


## Coder
The coder designs and edits the design genes, they also might configure design systems although this is mostly taken by the [Systems Designer]



## Carver
This is an extension of the [OpenBIM Ontologist] role, but it focuses on the Morphogenetic Carving. This is best described as using a [TUI] (tangible user interface) to augment the future desing experience. Linked Data is touted as a future information technology for the AECO however most implimentations focus on using it for analysis. The potential of operating directly on linked data graphs to design has yet to be fully explored. This is expllored in speculative papers employing a ['katana' TUI to carve the graph](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282664175_MorphoCarve_Carving_Morphogenetic_Prototypes) in an XR environment.


## Analyst

This shares some similarities to the [OpenBIM Analyst] role, but it focuses on the Morphogenetic analysis.


## Modeller
This shares some similarities to the [OpenBIM Modeller] role, but it focuses on the Morphogenetic modelling.


## Futurologist
This rooe 'will' become increasingly useful in the future. Whether it is predicting the future life cycles of prodcuts and materials or defining the future challenges to the built and natural environments.
