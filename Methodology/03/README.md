# Agile Prototyping Part 3 - Biomimetic Search
Please note that this part is iterative, for inspiration we should look to Lenau 2009. This part relies on you already having completed parts [1] and [2] and having a staged development diagram with functions expressed in nouns and verbs.

## AP3 steps

### 1. Functional analysis
In this step you take the function you defined in the the last step of AP2.
* Fill in the 'functions' table.
* Use the functions table to fill out the functional tree, carfully seperating functions and means.
* Relate this back to stages you defined in AP2.

### 2. Specificaiton
This step results in the requirements that need to be focus the biomimetic search and test your design.
* Apply these to the stages you identified in AP2.
* 

### 3. Search
You can do this in a number of ways:
* Brainstorm ideas from memory or experience, where does Biology also offer that function.

### 4. Focus
reflect on the proximity to the requirements you identified in step 2 for each biomimetic concept. Select one that best satisifies the requirements and inspires you with 'design' ideas / neww solutions.

### 5. Design and Test
* Apply the biological inspiration to a specific growth stage in system. y
* There is no specific way to do this stage.
* Choose an approach that works for you.
* Check against requirements, does it satisfy the requirements from step 2?
* The output of this is probably a drawing, but this is also a case of waht works for you.

#### AP3.1 Asknature
Next we select a stage and take the function for that stage previously expressed in step AP2-5 and try and match it to a biomimetic example using [asknature.org](Http://asknature.org). For instance for the _provide grip_ function we can find an example of how square [seahorse] tails help it grip.

#### AP3.2 Apply to Stage
Design a new feature for the stage to satisfy the identified function.

#### AP3.3 Adapt other Stages
Inspired by the examples from your biomimetic search, design new features that could satisfy the same function. Adjust the upper stages to reflect the changes your new features make and the resulting phenotype.

#### AP3.4 Update Phenotype
Apply the changes in the other stages to the phenotype.

#### AP3.5 Is this what you want?
In this case not really, the pencil would no longer fit in a pencil sharpener and if it did work it would no longer provide the grip function. Back to AP3.1, or keep the original and move on. It is important here also to log the functional clarification that we gained in this step.

#### B2. Create new features for each stage
