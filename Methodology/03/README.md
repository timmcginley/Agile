## Agile Prototyping Part 3 - Biomimetic Search
Please note that this part is iterative, for inspiration we should look to Lenau 2009

This part relies on you already having completed parts [1] and [2] and having a staged development diagram with functions expressed in nouns and verbs.

#### AP3.1 Asknature
Next we select a stage and take the function for that stage previously expressed in step AP2-5 and try and match it to a biomimetic example using [asknature.org](Http://asknature.org). For instance for the _provide grip_ function we can find an example of how square [seahorse] tails help it grip.

#### AP3.2 Apply to Stage
Design a new feature for the stage to satisfy the identified function.

#### AP3.3 Adapt other Stages
Inspired by the examples from your biomimetic search, design new features that could satisfy the same function. Adjust the upper stages to reflect the changes your new features make and the resulting phenotype.

#### AP3.4 Update Phenotype
Apply the changes in the other stages to the phenotype.

#### AP3.5 Is this what you want?
In this case not really, the pencil would no longer fit in a pencil sharpener and if it did work it would no longer provide the grip function. Back to AP3.1, or keep the original and move on. It is important here also to log the functional clarification that we gained in this step.

#### B2. Create new features for each stage
