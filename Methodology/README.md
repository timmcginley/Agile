# Agile Prototyping Methodology

Agile Prototyping focuses on

- '[meta disciplinary]' Building Elements / systems
- identification of common analysis methods
- Building systems should be 'hot swappable' in a design process.
- We should make the future design experience we want

The methodology has X steps, which you will gaing experience of in this course.

1. For your chosen [focus] area, you need to do the following:

### 1. Identify the artefact (the simpler the better)
![Step 1](/Agile/img/Methodology/01.PNG)
### 2. Check for symmetry / primary axis
![Step 2](/Agile/img/Methodology/02.PNG)
### 3. Identify segments 
![Step 3](/Agile/img/Methodology/03.PNG)
### 4. Define the scope of the study (smaller the better)
![Step 4](/Agile/img/Methodology/04.PNG)
### 5. Identify artefact features and their affordances
![Step 5](/Agile/img/Methodology/05.PNG)
### 6. Reverse engineer an instance of the system / artefact
![Step 6a](/Agile/img/Methodology/06a.PNG)
#### 6b. What is the 'egg' stage of your artefact / scoped system?
![Step 6b](/Agile/img/Methodology/06b.PNG)
#### 6c. Find feature A.
![Step 6c](/Agile/img/Methodology/06c.PNG)
#### 6c. Find feature B.
Consider if the design was 'growing' at would stage would feature B 'express' itself, would it be before or after the other features. Repeat steps 6c and 6d.

### 7. Identify stages in the ‘development’ of the instance
![Step 7](/Agile/img/Methodology/07.PNG)
### 8. Identify ‘genes’ on other ‘species’ that are closely related to your artefact using ‘comparative biology’
![Step 8](/Agile/img/Methodology/08.PNG)
### 9. Having mapped the stages then we can then work out the evolution of the artefact

### 1. Identify the functions
* Define the functions of your chosen building system.
* What features of a cup support these functions?

### 2. Feature variables
* Imagine a universal design system for your building system;
  * How would your building systems features change for different building projects?
  * What variables would these features have?
  * Could you define the range of the variables that could support any building?
 
### 3. Out of order?
* Thinking procedurally, in what order would we apply functions to the design?
* Can we find a universal 'pseudo' developmental sequence for your building system?
* Which feature would appear first?

### 4. Is is growing?
* Could we consider these functional variables to be a bit like the suppression and expression of genes in a growing organism?


<!---

The Methodology is derived from future studies. rather than just speculate on what could be it uses the futures literature methods of 
* Forecasting (looking forward),
* Backcasting (identifying the implications for today on proposed future),
* Pastcasting (learning from the past)
* Recasting (aligning the past to the projected future)
Its process is described in the digram below:

## 1. Forecast *Futures*
We do this in [Assignment 1]. This part identifies the near, medium and long term futures that will provide the future context of the agile prototype. It has the following substeps:
* forecast future using 3 horizons framework
* This follows the **Design Gene Indentification Process (DGIP).**

## 2. Needs *Backcast*
We do this in [Assignment 2]. This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

* identify the challenges of this future for a specific building system or product.
* This follows the **[Agile Future Design Plan (AFDP)]**.

## 3. Analyse *Pastcast*
We do this in [Assignment 3]. This part ['reverse engineers'] the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## 4. Change *Recast*
We do this in [Assignment 4]. Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?

## Reflect
We do this in [Assignment 5]. Does the Prototype support the future? In the end is it a future that you want? would you change this? what does this mean for the building systems that we design today.
