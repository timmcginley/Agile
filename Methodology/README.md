# Agile Prototyping Methodology

Agile Prototyping focuses on

- '[meta disciplinary]' Building Elements / systems
- identification of common analysis methods
- Building systems should be 'hot swappable' in a design process.
- We should make the future design experience we want

The Methodology is derived from future studies. rather than just speculate on what could be it uses the futures literature methods of 
* Forecasting (looking forward),
* Backcasting (identifying the implications for today on proposed future),
* Pastcasting (learning from the past)
* Recasting (aligning the past to the projected future)
Its process is described in the digram below:

## 1. Forecast *Futures*
We do this in [Assignment 1]. This part identifies the near, medium and long term futures that will provide the future context of the agile prototype. It has the following substeps:
1. forecast future using 3 horizons framework

## 2. Needs *Backcast*
We do this in [Assignment 2]. This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

2. identify the challenges of this future for a specific building system or product.

## 3. Analyse *Pastcast*
We do this in [Assignment 3]. This part 'reverse engineers' the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## 4. Change *Recast*
We do this in [Assignment 4]. Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?

## Reflect
We do this in [Assignment 5]. Does the Prototype support the future? In the end is it a future that you want? would you change this? what does this mean for the building systems that we design today.
