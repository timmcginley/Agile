# Agile Prototyping Methodology

The Methodology has 4 parts:

## Future *Forecast*
This part identifies the near, medium and long term futures that will provide the future context of the agile prototype. It has the following substeps:
1. forecast future using 3 horizons framework
2. identify the challenges of this future for a specific building system or product.

# Needs *Backcast*
This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

# Analyse *Pastcast*
This part 'reverse engineers' the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

# Change *Recast*
Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?
