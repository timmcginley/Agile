# Agile Prototyping Methodology

Agile Prototyping focuses on

- '[meta disciplinary]' Building Elements / systems
- identification of common analysis methods
- Building systems should be 'hot swappable' in a design process.
- We should make the future design experience we want

The methodology has X steps, which you will gaing experience of in this course.

1. For your chosen [focus] area, you need to do the following:

### 1. Identify artefact / system
If this is your first time doing this, it is best to start from something simple, here we use the example of a pencil.

![Step 01](/Agile/img/Methodology/01.PNG)
### 2. Check for symmetry / primary axis
Not all artefacts / systems will have a primary axis. In this case the axis is more important than the symmetry. the axis defines a front and back or an up and down. This will help us to understand the distribution of features along the artefact. In animals the HOX genes (a set of genes that express major features such as the head and torso, appear in the same sequence in DNA that they do in the axis of the animal). So in this exercise you are also starting to organise the genetic code of the artefact.

### 3. Identify segments 
Having defined the axis in the previous step, if the system exhibits symmetry you can divide it into segments along the axis, there may be some overlap between these segments. To start with you are observing segments that you can see from the outside. But in some instances we may need to include features that would only be visible if the artefact was transparent. Sidenote: I googled but couldn't find an xray of a pencil...

### 4. Define the scope of the study (smaller the better)
you may be more interested in some segments than others. It can be a good idea to scope your study by reducing the number of segments you will study. It is recommended that the study area should still be contiguous. If not it might be better to divide the study into seperate studies for each contiguous area. The scoped area below of x1 and x2 is contiguous.

### 5. Identify artefact features and their affordances
Having identified the axis, segments and scope(s) of your study. You can now start to break identify specific features that are expressed in that segment.

### 6. Reverse engineer an instance of the system / artefact
Until now we have made observations about  the physical pencil. The final design object. What biologists would call the 'phenotype'. It is the adult, fully grown organism. For the next steps you need to use a mixture of imagination and logic to determine the 'growth stages' of the artfact / system. Starting with the final stage (the 'real' pencil / artefact / system)
Having annotated / listed the features for each segment. Next you need to idenitfy the 'order' that these features conceptually express in the these features would

#### 6b. What is the 'egg' stage of your artefact / scoped system?

![Step 06b](/Agile/img/Methodology/06b.PNG)

#### 6c. Find feature A.

![Step 06c](/Agile/img/Methodology/06c.PNG)

#### 6c. Find feature B.
Consider if the design was 'growing' at would stage would feature B 'express' itself, would it be before or after the other features. Repeat steps 6c and 6d.

![Step 06d](/Agile/img/Methodology/06d.PNG)

### 7. Identify stages in the ‘development’ of the instance

![Step 07](/Agile/img/Methodology/07.PNG)

### 8. Identify ‘genes’ on other ‘species’ that are closely related to your artefact using ‘comparative biology’

![Step 08](/Agile/img/Methodology/08.PNG)

### 09. Having mapped the stages then we can then work out the evolution of the artefact

### 1. Identify the functions
* Define the functions of your chosen building system.
* What features of a cup support these functions?

### 2. Feature variables
* Imagine a universal design system for your building system;
  * How would your building systems features change for different building projects?
  * What variables would these features have?
  * Could you define the range of the variables that could support any building?
 
### 3. Out of order?
* Thinking procedurally, in what order would we apply functions to the design?
* Can we find a universal 'pseudo' developmental sequence for your building system?
* Which feature would appear first?

### 4. Is is growing?
* Could we consider these functional variables to be a bit like the suppression and expression of genes in a growing organism?


<!---

The Methodology is derived from future studies. rather than just speculate on what could be it uses the futures literature methods of 
* Forecasting (looking forward),
* Backcasting (identifying the implications for today on proposed future),
* Pastcasting (learning from the past)
* Recasting (aligning the past to the projected future)
Its process is described in the digram below:

## 1. Forecast *Futures*
We do this in [Assignment 1]. This part identifies the near, medium and long term futures that will provide the future context of the agile prototype. It has the following substeps:
* forecast future using 3 horizons framework
* This follows the **Design Gene Indentification Process (DGIP).**

## 2. Needs *Backcast*
We do this in [Assignment 2]. This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

* identify the challenges of this future for a specific building system or product.
* This follows the **[Agile Future Design Plan (AFDP)]**.

## 3. Analyse *Pastcast*
We do this in [Assignment 3]. This part ['reverse engineers'] the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## 4. Change *Recast*
We do this in [Assignment 4]. Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?

## Reflect
We do this in [Assignment 5]. Does the Prototype support the future? In the end is it a future that you want? would you change this? what does this mean for the building systems that we design today.
