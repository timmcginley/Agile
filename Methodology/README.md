# Agile Prototyping (AP) Methodology
>Agile Prototyping is a [meta disciplinary] comparative design and analysis method for physical systems and artefacts. It imagines that we are biologists trying to make sense of artificial design when have only seen biological design before. 

### Biology as a lens to support metadisciplinary building analysis
Biologists call a fully grown organism the [phenotype] and the genetic code that created it the [genotype]. Obviously buildings do not 'really' have genes. However before biologists could understand the genes of an organism from genetic sequencing, they used comparative biology (measuring, drawing and inferring differences between species) to 'guess' the genes of the organism, this did not work brilliantly as observable traits in the phenotype are rarely the result of a single gene, however it did get them started. Agile Prototyping applies the same approach to guess and sequence the 'genes' of building systems.


they used to AP adapts pre genetic sequencing comparative biology techniques to infer:
- the features and functions,
- genes and growth (developmental) stages, 
- and evolution of systems and artefacts.

AP then uses these to support a 
- to support a fast, informed and agile design experience of artificial systems for the 21st century.

### Where did it come from?
Agile Prototyping, combines the [morphogenetic Prototyping] (MP) methods I developed between 2014 and 2018 in Australia, with a clearer interface to traditional [biomimetics] and a better understanding of systems engineering. MP was for buildings Whereas [Agile Prototyping] is intended for building systems, their integration into buildings and, in future iterations, other products.

### How you can use it?
Agile Prototyping provides a framework to analyse, guide and reconfigure designs based on your disciplinary expertise. 

### Sounds complicated?
Not really :) We have broken the methodology into 10 Analysis steps. The first five only require you to observe and think about the functions and features of the system or artefact you are applying this to. Stages 5 - 10 encourage you to use your imagination to order the stages you fit the features and functions yout idenitfy into. It then asks you to compare or integrate this with the growth of other systems or artefacts.

### How are we going to learn all that?
The course uses a spiral learning technique, wherein you repeat the same method with increasing levels of complexity inorder to master it and be able to use it independently. 
Therefore in this course we use the method in the following ways:
1. [A1] your first experience wiht teh method focusing on a cup (All steps)
2. [A2] your second experience (Steps 1 - 5) this time with a building system
3. [A3] your third experience (Steps 6 - 10) this time with a building system
4. [A4] your fourth experience (all stages) this time with a complete building
5. [A5] reflect on your learning through these spirals.

### Ok, lets go, how do we do it?
Great! Just follow these steps For your chosen [focus] area:

### 1. Identify artefact / system
If this is your first time doing this, it is best to start from something simple, here we use the example of a pencil.

![Step 01](/Agile/img/Methodology/01.PNG)
### 2. Check for symmetry / primary axis
Not all artefacts / systems will have a primary axis. In this case the axis is more important than the symmetry. The axis defines a front and back or an up and down. This will help us to understand the distribution of features along the artefact. In animals the HOX genes (a set of genes that express major features such as the head and torso, appear in the same sequence in DNA that they do in the axis of the animal). So in this exercise you are also starting to organise the genetic code of the artefact.

![Step 02](/Agile/img/Methodology/02.PNG)
### 3. Identify segments 
Having defined the axis in the previous step, if the system exhibits symmetry you can divide it into segments along the axis, there may be some overlap between these segments. To start with you are observing segments that you can see from the outside. But in some instances we may need to include features that would only be visible if the artefact was transparent. Sidenote: I googled but couldn't find an xray of a pencil...

![Step 03](/Agile/img/Methodology/03.PNG)

### 4. Define the scope of the study (smaller the better)
you may be more interested in some segments than others. It can be a good idea to scope your study by reducing the number of segments you will study. It is recommended that the study area should still be contiguous. If not it might be better to divide the study into seperate studies for each contiguous area. The scoped area below of x1 and x2 is contiguous.

![Step 04](/Agile/img/Methodology/04.PNG)

### 5. Identify artefact features and their affordances
Having identified the axis, segments and scope(s) of your study. You can now start to break identify specific features that are expressed in that segment. 

![Step 05](/Agile/img/Methodology/05.PNG)

### 6. Reverse engineer an instance of the system / artefact
Until now we have made observations about  the physical pencil. The final design object. What biologists would call the 'phenotype'. It is the adult, fully grown organism. For the next steps you need to use a mixture of imagination and logic to determine the 'growth stages' of the artfact / system. Starting with the final stage (the 'real' pencil / artefact / system)
Having annotated / listed the features for each segment. Next you need to idenitfy the 'order' that these features conceptually express in the these features would 

![Step 06a](/Agile/img/Methodology/06a.PNG)

#### 6b. What is the 'egg' stage of your artefact / scoped system?

![Step 06b](/Agile/img/Methodology/06b.PNG)

#### 6c. Find feature A.

![Step 06c](/Agile/img/Methodology/06c.PNG)

#### 6c. Find feature B.
Consider if the design was 'growing' at would stage would feature B 'express' itself, would it be before or after the other features. Repeat steps 6c and 6d.

![Step 06d](/Agile/img/Methodology/06d.PNG)

### 7. Identify stages in the ‘development’ of the instance

![Step 07](/Agile/img/Methodology/07.PNG)

### 8. Identify ‘genes’ on other ‘species’ that are closely related to your artefact using ‘comparative biology’

![Step 08](/Agile/img/Methodology/08.PNG)

### 09. Having mapped the stages then we can then work out the evolution of the artefact

![Step 09](/Agile/img/Methodology/09.PNG)

### 10. Having mapped the stages then we can then work out the evolution of the artefact

### 1. Identify the functions
* Define the functions of your chosen building system.
* What features of a cup support these functions?

### 2. Feature variables
* Imagine a universal design system for your building system;
  * How would your building systems features change for different building projects?
  * What variables would these features have?
  * Could you define the range of the variables that could support any building?
 
### 3. Out of order?
* Thinking procedurally, in what order would we apply functions to the design?
* Can we find a universal 'pseudo' developmental sequence for your building system?
* Which feature would appear first?

![Pen and Pencil](/Agile/img/Pen_and_Pencil.png)

### 4. Is is growing?
* Could we consider these functional variables to be a bit like the suppression and expression of genes in a growing organism?


<!---

The Methodology is derived from future studies. rather than just speculate on what could be it uses the futures literature methods of 
* Forecasting (looking forward),
* Backcasting (identifying the implications for today on proposed future),
* Pastcasting (learning from the past)
* Recasting (aligning the past to the projected future)
Its process is described in the digram below:

## 1. Forecast *Futures*
We do this in [Assignment 1]. This part identifies the near, medium and long term futures that will provide the future context of the agile prototype. It has the following substeps:
* forecast future using 3 horizons framework
* This follows the **Design Gene Indentification Process (DGIP).**

## 2. Needs *Backcast*
We do this in [Assignment 2]. This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

* identify the challenges of this future for a specific building system or product.
* This follows the **[Agile Future Design Plan (AFDP)]**.

## 3. Analyse *Pastcast*
We do this in [Assignment 3]. This part ['reverse engineers'] the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## 4. Change *Recast*
We do this in [Assignment 4]. Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?

## Reflect
We do this in [Assignment 5]. Does the Prototype support the future? In the end is it a future that you want? would you change this? what does this mean for the building systems that we design today.
