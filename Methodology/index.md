# Morphogenetic Prototyping v0.5
>What if a biologist had never seen artificial design before?

**Morphogenetic Protototyping is a [meta disciplinary] design and analysis method for buildings and their systems.**

Biologists call a fully grown organism the [phenotype] and the genetic code that created it the [genotype]. Before biologists could understand the genes of an organism from genetic sequencing, they used comparative biology (measuring, drawing and inferring differences between species) to 'guess' the genes that encoded the organism. Morphogenetic Prototyping applies the same approach to guess and sequence the 'genes' of building systems. The current version of the method has 5 parts:

### [M1] Features
Identify the axis, 'segments', features and scope of the system or artefact you are studying.
- Explore Part 1 steps [here](/Agile/Methodology/01)

### [M2] Stages
Imagining it had really grown, in what order would the features appear and what is their function? The stages allow us to expand the linear design space into multiple parallel reversible tracks.
- Explore Part 2 steps [here](/Agile/Methodology/02)

### [M3] Biomimetics
Gain biomimetic inspiration for new solutions for the functions you have identified in each growth stage in [M2].
- Explore Part 3 steps [here](/Agile/Methodology/03)

### [M4] Evolution
Model the evolution of the building system to help us reuse, improve and learn from previous designs. Try and imagine what new systems might emerge in the future, based on your study.
- Explore Part 4 steps [here](/Agile/Methodology/04)

### AP[5] Architecture / Carve
Transplant materials and building systems at any stage in the design process. This final part requires new design experiences, tools, interfaces and collaboration opportunities for the 21st century.
- Explore Part 6 steps [here](/Agile/Methodology/05)

### How are we going to learn all that?
The course uses a spiral learning technique, wherein you repeat the same method with increasing levels of complexity inorder to master it and be able to use it independently. Therefore in this course we use the method in the following ways:

1. [A1] your first experience with the method focusing on a cup (PART [M1], [M2], [M3] and [M4])
2. [A2] your second experience (PART [M1]) this time with a building system
3. [A3] your third experience (PART [M2] and [M3]) this time with a building system
4. [A4] your fourth experience (All Parts) this time with a complete building.
5. [A5] reflect on your learning through these spirals.


### Where did it come from?
Morphogenetic Prototyping, originates in the [morphogenetic Prototyping] (MP) methods I developed between 2014 and 2018 in Australia, at DTU it has been refined to have a clearer interface to traditional [biomimetics] [M3] and a better understanding of systems engineering. Originally focused on Architectural design tasks, it has been extended here to focus on building systems, their integration into buildings and, in future iterations, other products.

### 1. Identify the functions
* Define the functions of your chosen building system.
* What features of a cup support these functions?

### 2. Feature variables
* Imagine a universal design system for your building system;
  * How would your building systems features change for different building projects?
  * What variables would these features have?
  * Could you define the range of the variables that could support any building?
 
### 3. Out of order?
* Thinking procedurally, in what order would we apply functions to the design?
* Can we find a universal 'pseudo' developmental sequence for your building system?
* Which feature would appear first?

### 4. Is is growing?
* Could we consider these functional variables to be a bit like the suppression and expression of genes in a growing organism?


<!---

The Methodology is derived from future studies. rather than just speculate on what could be it uses the futures literature methods of 
* Forecasting (looking forward),
* Backcasting (identifying the implications for today on proposed future),
* Pastcasting (learning from the past)
* Recasting (aligning the past to the projected future)
Its process is described in the digram below:

## 1. Forecast *Futures*
We do this in [Assignment 1]. This part identifies the near, medium and long term futures that will provide the future context of the agile prototype. It has the following substeps:
* forecast future using 3 horizons framework
* This follows the **Design Gene Indentification Process (DGIP).**

## 2. Needs *Backcast*
We do this in [Assignment 2]. This part identifies the requirements of the future product / system in you defined future.

* identify the challenges of this future for a specific building system or product.
* This follows the **[Agile Future Design Plan (AFDP)]**.

## 3. Analyse *Pastcast*
We do this in [Assignment 3]. This part ['reverse engineers'] the selected system to develop a recomposable 'agile prototype'. It identifies the features of the systems and disconnects these from its context.

## 4. Change *Recast*
We do this in [Assignment 4]. Consider the link between the 'current' trajectory you defined for your prototype in the previous part and your future scenarios. Is your agile prototype aligned? if not can you align it?

## Reflect
We do this in [Assignment 5]. Does the Prototype support the future? In the end is it a future that you want? would you change this? what does this mean for the building systems that we design today.
