## AP2 - Identify Stages

### AP2.1 Identify Stages
Until now we have made observations about the physical pencil. The final design object. What biologists would call the 'phenotype'. It is the adult, fully grown organism. The next steps you need to use a mixture of imagination and logic to determine the 'growth stages' of the artfact / system. Starting with the final stage (the 'real' pencil / artefact / system)
Having annotated / listed the features for each segment. To prepare for the next step, draw rows below your phenotype that Next you need to idenitfy the 'order' that these features conceptually express in the these features would

#### AP2.2 Identify the Proto Stage
This is the conceptual platonic start for your object. If it has a clear symmetry it is probably a tube rotated around the axis, but it could also be a plane. The first stage will might have little functional, geometric or material proximity to the phenotype.

#### AP2.3 Find feature A
Identify the first feature of the phenotype that you think should be included in the growth process. This first feature should be placed in between the start (proto) stage and the phenotype.

#### AP2.4 Find feature B (Reapeat until complete)
Consider if the design was 'growing' at would stage would feature B 'express' itself, would it be before or after the other features. Repeat steps 6c and 6d until you have arranged all the features you have found for the system / artefact into a sequence, that describes the conceptual development (growth) of the design. Congratulations! you have defined the growth stages of your system!

#### AP2.5 Identify the functions
For each of the stages identify the function that the feature is performing. You can start by writing this as a sentence and then write it verb, noun form as in the image below.
