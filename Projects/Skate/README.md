# Skate Park

## How could a skate park double up and have a second function in an urban environment?

Ebbe Lykke from [Glifberg-Lykke](https://www.glifberglykke.com/) Skatepark Architecture Design are intersted in the ideas that you can come up to integrate Skateparks into other built environment functions. Ebbe would like to come and talk wiht us soon, so we can find out more about the awesome work they do.

## Project Criterias: 

The Skatepark Design Systems Could:

### 01. Model the noise:
Analyse the acpustics for the skatepark (Acoustics is a major factor in planning permission for skateparks).

### 02. Material Properties:
Explore the suitablity of different materials - Concrete generally used in outside parks and timber inside. Can lower CO2 Concretes be used?

### 03. Have a 60-Year Lifespan (2024 - 2084):
Some parks have existed for over 40 years.

## 04. How is the park affected by weather?
What changes would need to be maded depending on the weather.

## 05. Intergration of water infrastructure.
Can the park be integrated into the water infrastructure?

### 06. Be Durable and Stable:
Create robust structures that can withstand wear and tear and are easy to maintain.

### 07. Follow Universal Design Principles:
Ensure that the park is accessible to all, including those with disabilities, by incorporating universal design features.

### 08. Be Cost-Effective:
Calculate the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of the materials used to ensure relative affordability and efficient resource utilization.

### 09. Be Easy to Maintain:
Design components that are easy to repair and replace, considering the limited resources available of the location

## 10. Reuse Elements
For instance if a concrete bridge was due for decomissioning could it be integrated and reused in the park?


Additionally, The Park Could:

### 12. Be Expandable:
Design the park with a modular approach that allows for future expansion and the addition of new modules as needed.


## Specific steps for this task

Define Objectives and Constraints:

### Future
Considering the near mid and far future, will help to frame the design of your building systems for this project. What are the external constraints, does skate(boarding) become highly regulated, or very free? Are people still stakeboarding in the future? what is the motivation to skate in the future? In this exercise you are developing a narrative which provides an opportunity to analyse its problems in the next part, look to the past following that and then propose chanes to your agile prototypes to meet the stated demands of your desired / feared futures. Remember that your future locks when you submit it. In the case of the skatepark the future must extend at least 60 years, as this is the service life of your systems. Additonally please think carefully about what this means for the futures of mobility, transportation, lesuire, recreation, sport and public space.

### Need
* Clearly outline the objectives of the skate park, including its purpose, functions, and the number of skaters it will support.
* Location: Choose a suitable location that offers accessibility, and resource availability in Denmark.
* Integrate in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems to extract water ice and other resources for life support and construction.
* Function Design: Develop the layout of the park, including the arrangement of main features and ancillary spaces.
* Brainstorm ideas and concepts for the park's layout, structures, and features.
* Consider the modular design to accommodate future expansion and ease of assembly - although Glifberg-Lykke concrete park are nomrally hand finished by a team of expert skaters, to allow maximum flexibility in design.

### Change
* Gather input from experts in various fields and stakeholders to refine the design.
* Iterate the design based on feedback and findings from simulations where possible.
* Identify constraints such as budget, materials, nnd available technology.
* Apply Universal Design Principles to ensure accessibility for all users.
* Design structures that can withstand outdoor conditions.
* Consider modular construction methods for ease of assembly.
* Choose local / circular / sustainable materials for construction.

### Analyse
* Study the design requirements for Skateparks.
* Research architectural and engineering solutions suitable for skatparks.
* Plan for energy generation using solar panels or other sustainable sources if your park has energy requirements.
* Incorporate energy storage solutions to provide lighting during the night
* Testing and Simulation: Use simulations, prototypes and testing to validate design concepts and assembly processes.
* Design modules that can be connected and disconnected easily for future expansion.
* Consider the 'skate lines' for additional expansion.
* Build: Plan step-by-step assembly procedures for the contractors.

# Documentation and Presentation:
Create detailed design documentation including drawings, schematics, and plans.
Prepare presentations to communicate the design to stakeholders and decision-makers.
