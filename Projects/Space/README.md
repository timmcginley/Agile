## Do you want to design the first step of the journey to a new planet? 

The journey to earth like planets outside of our solar system is not possible today, but a journey of a thousand steps ([or 4 light years]) starts with just 1 step.



## First step
The first step requires a moon base. Your task will therefore be to adapt your agile prototype you develop in this course to support a building system on a moon base.
Of course this will be a DTU base...

## Project Criterias: 

The BASE must:
* serve as accomiodation to support 8 astronauts at a time.
* (for the most parts) be constructed from *local* recyclable materials( ie. rigolith)
* have a life span of 100 years.
* be erectable within a maximum of three supply trips.
* be simple to build and to take down by astronauts.
* be durable and stable (able to withstand wind, weather and the curiosity of aliens)
* be accessible for all (follow Universal Design Principles)
* be (Relatively) inexpensive (the LCC of the materials must be calculated)
* Easy to maintain
* provide adequate indoor conditions
* protection from harmful radiation

It would also be great if the base could:
* be exapandable in the future
* be attached to a garage
