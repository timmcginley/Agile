# Space habitation
## Do you want to design the first step of the journey to a new planet? If so we need designs for designs on both the moon and mars.

DTU needs a new FrontLab pavilion, which represents the university's presence at Roskilde Festival.

Criterias: 

The pavilion must:
* serve as a DTU landmark at the festival (signal innovative thinking and have a discreet DTU logo)
* (for the most parts) be constructed from recyclable materials
* be reusable at least three times (preferably more)
* be erectable within a maximum of three days
* be simple to build and to take down by students from other studylines (i.e. comprehensible and simple instructions must be drawn up)
* be durable and stable (able to withstand wind, weather and the curiosity of festival-goers)
* be accessible for all (follow Universal Design Principles)
* be inexpensive (the cost of the materials canâ€™t exceed 150.000 DKK)

It would also be great if the pavilion:
* provides some shade and shelter
* can act as a stage for events
