# Projects 24

### Introduction

This course starts wiht a finished design and then we work togther to reverse engineer it. This enbales us to understand how the same building system can support different building projects.

Based on this we can then design the bulding system as a reconfigurable 'agile prototype' that we can integrate with other systems to adapt to different project requirements.

<!-- * support each of the 3 futures (near, mid and far) for either the planet A or planet B scenario you defined in [A1](/Agile/Assignments/A1)
-->

### Agile Protoype
This does *not mean* that the constructed prototype has to adapt like a transformer...

![transformer image](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/thumb/d/dc/OpTransformsSu.jpg/400px-OpTransformsSu.jpg)  

but that **the design of the agile prototype can** using [Computational and Parametric Design] techniques described in this course.

To acheive this, we will operate on different [building systems](/Agile/Systems/).

### This year

Your agile prototype needs to be able to: take a building:

* The designs from the Advanced Building Design Course (41936)
<!--* The model for the Skylab building on campus.-->

[Computational and Parametric Design]: /Agile/Concepts/ComputationalDesign

<!--

1. [Roskilde]
2. [Space]
3. [Skate]
4. [Skylab]

Finally you must make a [physical prototype]

[physical prototype]: /Agile/Concepts/PhysicalPrototype
[Roskilde]: /Agile/Projects/Roskilde
[Space]: /Agile/Projects/Space
[Skate]: /Agile/Projects/Skate
[Skylab]: /Agile/Projects/Skylab
