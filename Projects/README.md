# Projects

This year we will explore how to grow a building. You are not expected to 'really' grow a building, we want you to explore the idea to see where it goes. This year we have 3 options for how you can explore this.

1. As a game
2. As a computational [design system]
3. As a user [manual]

[game]: /Agile/Projects/Game
[design system]: /Agile/Projects/Parametric
[manual]: /Agile/Projects/Manual

### Agile Protoype
This does *not mean* that the constructed prototype has to adapt like a transformer...

![transformer image](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/thumb/d/dc/OpTransformsSu.jpg/400px-OpTransformsSu.jpg)  

but that **the design of the agile prototype can** using [Computational and Parametric Design] techniques described in this course.

To acheive this, we will operate on different [building systems](/Agile/Systems/).

### This year

Your agile prototype needs to be able to: take a building:

* The designs from the Advanced Building Design Course (41936)


* The model for the Skylab building on campus.-->



<!--

1. [Roskilde]
2. [Space]
3. [Skate]
4. [Skylab]

Finally you must make a [physical prototype]
