# Projects 24

Your agile prototype needs to be able to: take a building:

* The designs from the Advanced Building Design Course (41936)
* The model for the Skylab building on campus.

This course is different in that we start with the design and then reverse it, to better understand its component systems. The aim is that haivng doen this we will be able to design the systems as 'agile prototypes' that we can adapt to different project requirements.

* support each of the 3 futures (near, mid and far) for either the planet A or planet B scenario you defined in [A1](/Agile/Assignments/A1)

This does *not mean* that the constructed prototype has to adapt like a transformer...

![transformer image](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/thumb/d/dc/OpTransformsSu.jpg/400px-OpTransformsSu.jpg)

but that **the design of the agile prototype can** using [Computational and Parametric Design] techniques described in this course.

To acheive this, we will operate on different [building systems](/Agile/Systems/).


[Computational and Parametric Design]: /Agile/Concepts/ComputationalDesign

<!--

1. [Roskilde]
2. [Space]
3. [Skate]
4. [Skylab]

Finally you must make a [physical prototype]

[Space]: /Agile/Projects/Space
[Skate]: /Agile/Projects/Skate
[Skylab]: /Agile/Projects/Skylab
