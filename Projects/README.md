# Projects 23

We know its always hard to choose a project, so in this course you don't have to ... your agile prototype needs to be able to support each of the 3 projects we have proposed below.

Your task in your group is to develop Agile Prototype systems that can adapt to 3 different contexts. This does *not mean* that the constructed prototype has to adapt like a transformer...

but the that the design of the agile prototype can using [Computational and Parametric Design] techniques described in this course.

1. [Roskilde]
2. [Space]
4. [Skylab]

Finally you must make a [physical prototype]
