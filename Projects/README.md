# Projects 23

Your agile prototype needs to be able to:

* support each of the 3 futures (near, mid and far) for either the planet A or planet B scenario you defined in [A1](/Assignments/A1)

This does *not mean* that the constructed prototype has to adapt like a transformer...

but that **the design of the agile prototype can** using [Computational and Parametric Design] techniques described in this course.

1. [Roskilde]
2. [Space]
3. [Skate]
4. [Skylab]

Finally you must make a [physical prototype]
