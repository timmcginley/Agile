# Projects

This year we will explore how to grow a building. You are not expected to 'really' grow a building, we want you to explore the idea to see where it goes. This year we have 3 options for how you can explore this.

1. As a [Game]
2. As a Computational (Parametric) [Design System]
3. As a User [Manual]

_Wildcard option_ - Scaled physical model(s) (exhibition quality)

We will provide as a case study a previous project from the Advanced Building Design Course. [Enrolled students only]. You can then use that building to analyse and test your agile prototypes and your ideas for your Agile Prototyping projects for this semester, remember that you do not need to create a new design for a building, you are creating an agile prototype of a building system that can be combined in your selected project ([Game], [Design System] or [Manual]) or the wildcard option to help future building designers to understand how to grow a building.

### Agile Protoype
This does *not mean* that the constructed prototype has to adapt like a transformer...

![transformer image](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/thumb/d/dc/OpTransformsSu.jpg/400px-OpTransformsSu.jpg)  

but that **the design of the agile prototype can** using [Computational and Parametric Design] techniques described in this course.

To acheive this, we will operate on different [building systems](/Agile/Systems/).

### This year

Your agile prototype needs to be able to: take a building:

* The designs from the Advanced Building Design Course (41936)


* The model for the Skylab building on campus.-->

1. [Roskilde]
2. [Space]
3. [Skate]
4. [Skylab]

Finally you must make a [physical prototype]
