# Skylab Adapter

This is the loosest of all the briefs - and for good reason, often in the real world and certainly in the future the problem is not clearly defined - it might be a [wicked problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem) or an [unkown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns). Skylab have suggested 2 challenges they face, and you can think of ways to salve these with your agile prototype building systems. Furthermore you are encouraged to ask questions when you visit skylab in week 1 and use your observation skills to see if you can identify other challenges your group could work on.

## Skylabs own suggestions
* Waste collection and sorting for recycling - (Lab + Technology + Usual/normal trash) currently missing a global Skylab overview [Building Input / Output] (merge between general users and some more complex "trash" [e.g. GMO, chemicals, electronics, lithium, etc... ]).
* Nudging the students to swipe in and out (like Rejsekortet) when using the prototyping facilities.
* Monitoring Students usages of facilities (RFID systems) 
•	Indoor Climate - sensors and smart-house (Climify) - Save energy, Bring seasons in architecture concepts, climate change ready-made building? energy saving?
•	3D Virtual test platform for test building accessibility of disabled peoples or, autonomous robots and/or Safety measures (evacuations, emergency, etc...)

They are excited to see what you come up with :)
