# Manual

Clearly express the stages of building growth in the form of a manual.

For inspiration you could choose a
* [local toy manufacturer](https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/search?q=building)
* [flatpack furniture company](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/assembly-instructions-puba2cdc880)
* [Gundam Assembly instructions](https://manual.bandai-hobby.net/)

## Special considerations
* Do you imagine one manual for the buidling, or seperate manuals for each system?
* Manuals often start with tools or how to prepare the work area, what will yours say?
