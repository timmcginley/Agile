# Agile Prototyping

Agile Prototyping is a [methodology] for designing building systems in the future. Designing in the future requires an agile, approach to; model, adapt and redesign building systems and products, fast.

>How can we design buildings for the future, when the future is [unknowable]?

Agile Prototyping applies a biological science lens to extract and modify the ‘genes’ of the built environment. This enables future architectural engineers to analyse and (re)design the the pseudo genetic code of buildings and their systems, fast.  

Over 5 assignements we work out:

* [A1] How to Grow a Cup
* [A2] What a Building System Needs
* [A3] How a Building System might grow
* [A4] How to Grow a building
* [A5] What we learnt.
