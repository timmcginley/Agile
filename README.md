# Agile Prototyping

Previously we have left it open to you to define the focus and problem of your agile prototypes. This helped you to define your project later at thesis, however we learnt from the course feedback, that it would be helpful to reduce the options a bit :) Therefore we analysed the project choices from last year and checked based on your feedback in the recent google form. We will therefore offer nine focus areas this semester, which you can see below. There are still a lot of areas and some will be better supported than others, but we hope this reflects your diverse interests. It is also very appropriate to consider a 'major' and 'minor' in your projects. The feedback from the industry is that they want graduates that have a deep specialisation 'a major' that they can integrate with another aspect 'a minor'. An example would be the ability to perform both advanced structural and LCA analysis in a project.

## Project Options
This year we have three exciting options for different projects that you can contribute to this semester.

## Project examples
The table below describes how these projects in combination with your chosen focus area(s) are combined in the course to generate interesting questions to get your teeth into over a series of four agile sprints. More information about this method is provided after the table.

## Agile Prototyping Methodology
More detail about the future Engineering methodology used in the course to support you to develop solutions to one of the projects from the perspective of your focus area is provided below. Here you can also see how this is lined up to the course weeks. N.B. it is a moebius strip not a circle. Remember, to forecast the future, we first have to learn the past
