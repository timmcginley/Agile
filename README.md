# Agile Prototyping

>How can we design buildings for the future, when the future is [unknowable]?

Agile Prototyping is a [methodology] for designing building systems in the future. Designing in the future requires an agile, approach to; model, adapt and redesign building systems and products, fast.

Agile Prototyping applies a biological science lens to the built environment to extract and modify the ‘genes’ of the built environment. This enable future architectural engineers to hack the pseudo genetic code to analyse and (re)design buildings and their systems, fast. 

Over 5 assignements we work out:

* [A1] How to Grow a Cup
* [A2] What a Building System Needs
* [A3] How a Building System might grow
* [A4] How to Grow a building
* [A5] What we learnt.
