# Agile Prototyping

**The future is [uncertain]. So how can we design buildings for the future? Agile Prototyping is a [methodology] for designing building systems in the future.**


>Design in the future requires the synthesis of [meta disciplinary systems] from diverse disciplinary needs with [uncertain]ty.  This requires an agile, fast and robust approach to; model, adapt and redesign building systems and products.

This course provides the ‘future tools’ to enable participants to design ‘in the [future]’. The focus of the course is to support participants to model, design and analyse building systems, fast, in the near, mid and far [future] scenario that they define. In the course, students extend their perspective of the present towards Elise Boulding’s idea of a 200 year present. Working in groups, they:

1. forecast a near, mid and far future
2. identify the requirements of this future on our building systems.
3. Reverse engineer existing building systems
4. Re engineer those systems to their proposed futures.

## Methodology
The Agile Prototyping methodology synthesises:
- [agile design processes](Concepts/Agile) 
- [computational design](Concepts/ComputationalDesign)
- [biomimetics](Concepts/Biomimetics) / [Morphogenetic Prototyping](Concepts/MorphogeneticPrototyping)
- [future forecasting](Concepts/Futures)

The course provides participants with a future focused design, analysis and modelling skills in architectural engineering. Agile Prototyping applies a biological science lens to the built environment to extract and modify the ‘genes’ of the built environment. This enable future architectural engineers to hack the pseudo genetic code of our built environment for the fast (re)design and analysis of our built environment.


## Assignment
There are four assignments.

## A1 Futures
1. **FORECASTING** / FUTURES : Define 3 future scenarios near, medium and far using the 3 Horizons Framework and Science Fiction Prototyping.
2. META DISCIPLINARY SYSTEMS: Define a specific building system, that you will develop an agile prototype of in the course.
3. TARGET: Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Forecasting with the purpose of guiding innovation by creating a target that you can use to test your agile prototypes later in the course.

## A2 Needs
4. **BACKCASTING** / NEEDS: Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Backcasting with the purpose of supporting codesign of solutions.
5. REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING: Traditional requirements engineering concepts are extended here so that they can used in meta disciplinary analysis of a selected building system.
6. DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (DSRM): This stage introduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that students define their solution objectives, based on then problem identification in the previous stage.

## A3 Analysis
7. **PASTCASTING** / AGILE PROTOTYPE: Focus on the modelling of the agile Prototype using biodigital prototyping methods.
8. BIO REVERSE ENGINEERING: Reverse engineer the features (genes) and pseudo developmental stages of the agile prototype (building system or product).
- PASTCASTING: Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Pastcasting with the purpose of revealing biases.
9. This applies the concepts of biological development to inform the development of our agile biodigtal prototype.
- This follows the design and development and demonstration stages of DSRM.

## A4 Change
- **RECASTING** / CHANGE:  Model the history (evolution) of the prototype and use this to determine the prototype’s current future trajectory.
- This happens by applying the biological concept of evolutionary development to the
‘Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of recasting with the purpose of evoking imagination and in our case imagining the future trajectory of building system features based on their current ‘genes’ identified in assignment 2 and future needs.
- This follows the evaluate and communicate steps of the DSRM.

## Project Options
This year we have three exciting options for different projects that you can contribute to this semester.

## Project examples
The table below describes how these projects in combination with your chosen focus area(s) are combined in the course to generate interesting questions to get your teeth into over a series of four agile sprints. More information about this method is provided after the table.

## Agile Prototyping Methodology
More detail about the future Engineering methodology used in the course to support you to develop solutions to one of the projects from the perspective of your focus area is provided below. Here you can also see how this is lined up to the course weeks. N.B. it is a moebius strip not a circle. Remember, to forecast the future, we first have to learn the past
