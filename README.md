# Agile Prototyping

**The future is [unknowable]. So how can we design buildings for the future? Agile Prototyping is a [methodology] for designing building systems in the future.**

>Design in the future requires the synthesis of [meta disciplinary systems] from diverse disciplinary needs with [uncertain]ty.  This requires an agile, fast and robust approach to; model, adapt and redesign building systems and products.

This course provides the ‘future tools’ to enable participants to design ‘in the [future]’. The focus of the course is to support participants to model, design and analyse building systems, fast, in the near, mid and far [future] scenario that they define. In the course, students extend their perspective of the present towards Elise Boulding’s idea of a 200 year present. Working in groups, they:

1. forecast a near, mid and far future
2. identify the requirements of this future on our building systems.
3. Reverse engineer existing building systems
4. Re engineer those systems to their proposed futures.

## Methodology
The Agile Prototyping methodology synthesises:
- [agile design processes](Concepts/Agile) 
- [computational design](Concepts/ComputationalDesign)
- [biomimetics](Concepts/Biomimetics) / [Morphogenetic Prototyping](Concepts/MorphogeneticPrototyping)
- [future forecasting](Concepts/Futures)

The course provides participants with a future focused design, analysis and modelling skills in architectural engineering. Agile Prototyping applies a biological science lens to the built environment to extract and modify the ‘genes’ of the built environment. This enable future architectural engineers to hack the pseudo genetic code of our built environment for the fast (re)design and analysis of our built environment. This year we have four exciting [projects] that you can contribute to this semester.
