# Agile Prototyping

The future is uncertain. 

Architectural engineering with uncertainty requires agile thinking, in order to model, adapt and redesign building systems and products fast.

This course aims to provide ‘future tools’ to enable participants to design ‘in the future’. The focus of the course is to support participants to model, design and analyse building systems, fast, for a clearly defined future scenario. In the course, students extend their view of the present towards Elise Boulding’s idea of a 200 year present. Working in groups, they develop an ‘Agile Prototype’ of a building system or product that includes 100 years of the building system or products past, as well as 100 years of its future.

## Methodology
The Agile Prototyping methodology synthesises:
- agile design processes
- computational design
- biomimetics and
- future forecasting

It provides participants with a future focused design, analysis and modelling skills in architectural engineering. Agile Prototyping applies a biological science lens to the built environment to identify the ‘genes’ of the built environment. This will enable future architectural engineers to hack the pseudo genetic code of our built environment. To enable the fast (re)design and analysis of our built environment.


## Assignments

## A1 Futures
Define 3 future scenarios near, medium and far using the 3 Horizons Framework and Science Fiction Prototyping. Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Forecasting with the purpose of guiding innovation by creating a target that you can use to test your agile prototypes later in the course.

## A2 Needs
Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Backcasting with the purpose of supporting codesign of solutions. The concepts are based in traditional in requirements engineering but they extended so that they can used in meta disciplinary analysis of the selected building system. This stage intorduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that students define their solution objectives, based on then problem identification in the previous stage.

## A3 Analysis
Focus on the modelling of the agile Prototype using biodigital prototyping methods. Reverse engineer the features (genes) and pseudo developmental stages of the agile prototype (building system or product). Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Pastcasting with the purpose of revealing biases. This applies the concepts of biological development to inform the development of our agile biodigtal prototype. This follows the design and development and demonstration stages of DSRM.

## A4 Change
Model the history (evolution) of the prototype and use this to determine the prototype’s current future trajectory. This happens by applying the biological concept of evolutionary development to the
‘Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of recasting with the purpose of evoking imagination and in our case imagining the future trajectory of building system features based on their current ‘genes’ identified in assignment 2 and future needs. This follows the evaluate and communicate steps of the DSRM.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
- Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
- Reverse engineer the pseudo biological developmental stages of the system based on the identified features to transform the building system or product into an ‘Agile Prototype' (AP).
- Model and traverse a phylogenetic tree of the features of AP to identify new solutions.
- Apply computational modelling techniques to model the evolution of the AP.
- Extrapolate the future features of the AP based on its evolution.
- Reflect on the APs genetic future trajectory.
- Define the three horizons of a future scenario and explore the future of the AP.
- Adapt the AP to the three horizons of the future scenario.
- Define an agile roadmap for the AP to solve the identified problem.
- Evaluate their proposed AP.
- Reflect on the process of developing the AP and communicate this for current and future students.
  
Previously we have left it open to you to define the focus and problem of your agile prototypes. This helped you to define your project later at thesis, however we learnt from the course feedback, that it would be helpful to reduce the options a bit :) Therefore we analysed the project choices from last year and checked based on your feedback in the recent google form. We will therefore offer nine focus areas this semester, which you can see below. There are still a lot of areas and some will be better supported than others, but we hope this reflects your diverse interests. It is also very appropriate to consider a 'major' and 'minor' in your projects. The feedback from the industry is that they want graduates that have a deep specialisation 'a major' that they can integrate with another aspect 'a minor'. An example would be the ability to perform both advanced structural and LCA analysis in a project.

## Project Options
This year we have three exciting options for different projects that you can contribute to this semester.

## Project examples
The table below describes how these projects in combination with your chosen focus area(s) are combined in the course to generate interesting questions to get your teeth into over a series of four agile sprints. More information about this method is provided after the table.

## Agile Prototyping Methodology
More detail about the future Engineering methodology used in the course to support you to develop solutions to one of the projects from the perspective of your focus area is provided below. Here you can also see how this is lined up to the course weeks. N.B. it is a moebius strip not a circle. Remember, to forecast the future, we first have to learn the past
