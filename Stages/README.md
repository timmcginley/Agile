# Stages

The main focus of the course is to determine the 'growth stages' of a building. We have been investigating this for many years. here are our best appraoches so far.

# Meta Discipline Development Stages

The above diagram from McGinley & Krijnen 2023, describes the conceptual subdivisions a building goes through. This is one way to represent imagine the growth of a building.

1. Project
2. Site
3. Building
4. Skin [(Facade)](/Agile/Systems/Facade)
5. [Core](/Agile/Systems/Facade)
6. [Space](/Agile/Systems/Space)
7. [Structure](/Agile/Systems/Structure) and [Services](/Agile/Systems/Services)
8. Stuff

Unfortunately the MDDS only inlcudes a single floor, so it is not given explicitly as a stage, but it would ould probably go after building and before skin (facade).

# Morphogenetic Architecture Framework

McGinley (2015) diagram tries to align common BIM 'level of development' to the biological development (growth) of fruit fly (drosophila melanogaster) larvae. This defined the 'building development stages (BDS) for the first time. It would be really cool, if nearly 10 years later we can finally define these in detail in this year's course.
