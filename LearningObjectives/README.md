# Learning Objectives

[Agile](/)

1. Identify a building system or product that has or could address a current or emerging disciplinary problem in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.
1. Identify the ‘phenotypic’ features of a building system or product.
1. [Reverse engineer] the pseudo biological developmental stages of the system based on the identified features to transform the building system or product into an ‘Agile Prototype' (AP).
1. Model and traverse a phylogenetic tree of the features of AP to identify new solutions.
1. Apply computational modelling techniques to model the evolution of the AP.
1. Extrapolate the future features of the AP based on its evolution.
1. Reflect on the APs genetic future trajectory.
1. Define the three horizons of a future scenario and explore the future of the AP.
1. Adapt the AP to the three horizons of the future scenario.
1. Define an agile roadmap for the AP to solve the identified problem.
1. Evaluate their proposed AP.
1. Reflect on the process of developing the AP and communicate this for current and future students.
