# Services
>includes: Horizontal services (in collaboration with floor) and Vertical services (in collaboration with core)

The services system has a unique growth perspective because it 'grows' in response to the needs of spaces of the building. It includes the main nervous / sensing systems of the building. It grows with and for the spaces. It needs to make the spaces and confortable and safe.

## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

The services system has many elements. In this stage please focus on the system and its element you wish to study further. It could be anything from the ducts to the air handling units to the sprinkler, water, energy and electrical system.

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

* This could would the line by which the service is supplied.
* It could also be acoustic dampening of ducts or spaces. In this case this would be layers applied to a surface.

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

* this could be the segments in a HVAC system. It might inlcude the inlets and outlets.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

Next you should scope your investigation of the service system segments. This is up to you to define.

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the fire segments that are in the scope of your study.
