# Build

The build system has a unique growth perspective.

## AP1.1
> Identify Artefact or System

Select a system to grow. Here you will study how the element arrives on site and is processed until it is installed in its final position. As a starting point you could take the traditional process, but imagine that the element 'floats' through the site into its final position.

## AP1.2
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

In this case the 'organising line' is the movement and processing of the element until it is installed on site. The build system also includes the 2D zones of the site as well as the 3D zones of the fully constructed building.
