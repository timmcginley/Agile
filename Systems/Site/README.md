Site is view here as:
* the conceptual origin of the process in the [design grid]
* an opportunity for the inclusion of biodiversity strategies
* A store of catalysing element for a 'real' biological building growth process
* The resistor and transferer of structural load from the building
* Control water runoff, capture, cleaning and cloud burst scenarios
