# Materials

Material systems has a unique growth perspective. The focus here is either on 
* The growth of the material specification that can be used to define the most appropriate material for each element in the building.
* Similar to the build perspective exploring the complete lifecycle of the material from raw or reuse through to end of life. This lifecycle system, can start of vague and then grows in certainty with the growth of the building. 

Similar to a build system, material system can be attached (and dettached) to each element in the building. The material system should be carefully considered with its implications for the selection of build systems for each element.

## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

Each element in the building has its own material system to descirbe and satisfy its unique material requirements.  These material systems combine to create a total material system for all elements in the building. 
* Choose one of the build systems (not material system).
* Then choose an element in that system. 
* Consider how the element arrives on site and is processed until it is installed in its final location in the building. As a starting point you could take the traditional process, but imagine that the element 'floats' through the site into its final position.

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

In this case the 'organising line' is the movement and processing of the element until it is installed on site. The build system also includes the 2D zones of the site as well as the 3D zones of the fully constructed building.

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

The next stage is to define the segments or zones within the line, surface or volume that the installation of the element requires, this should include the delivery, set down, storage, adaptation, internal site movement, installation, fixing and testing.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

It is probably not possible to study all the processes you have identified in detail. 

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the segements that are in the scope of your study. For instance a feature might be a facade elment being fixed to a floor slab. It might be the decision to move an element with a crane or inside the building. It might be applying a protective cover to the element to protect it on site.
