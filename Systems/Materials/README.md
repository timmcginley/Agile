# Materials

Material systems have a unique growth perspective. The focus here is either on:
* The heirachical 'growth' of the MATERIAL specification that can be used to define the most appropriate material for each element in the building.
* Similar to the build perspective exploring the complete lifecycle of the material from raw or reuse through to end of life. This lifecycle system, can start of vague and then grows in certainty with the growth of the building. 

Similar to a [build] system, a MATERIAL system can be attached (and dettached) to each element in the building. The MATERIAL system should be carefully considered with its implications for the selection of [build] systems for each element.

## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

Each element in the building has its own MATERIAL system to describe and satisfy its unique material requirements.  These MATERIAL systems combine to create a total MATERIAL system for all elements in the building. 
* Choose one of the building systems.
* Then choose an element in that system. 
* Consider either the MATERIAL requrirements of the element for each stage of its lifecycle.
*  Also at this stage we should define the functional unit of the MATERIAL

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

In this case the 'organising line' is the life cycle of the material.

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments, Zones or Phases

The next stage is to define the phases within the lifecycle, surface or volume that the installation of the element requires.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

It is probably not possible to study all the phases you have identified in detail.

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the phases in the scope of your study.
