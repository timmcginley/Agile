>This system includes: The plenum, horizontal structure and services

The fire system has a unique growth perspective because it 'grows' in response to the needs of their systems in the building. It is incorporated into the main nervous / sensing system of the building, it grows with the spaces. It provides protection in a similar way to the way that the facade does but for the use case of fire. It needs to alert users to the danger. Offer a safe route out of the building. Reinforce critical structural elments to make sure they do not fail before the users can evacuate and remove smoke and heat from the building. Finally it should compartmentalise the fire and or smoke to avoid it spreading.


## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

The fire system has many elements. In this stage please focus on the system and its element you wish to study further. It could be anything from the sprinkler and detection units to the fire evacuation routes in the building.

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

* The fire system could be sampling the air for smoke and heat in a space. These points connect to each other in the building. Triggering other responses. In this way the growth system could be the growth of the fire detection system
* Alternatively it could be the growth of the evacuation route through the building.
* Perhaps it could also be the protective growth of fire insulating material around an element. This would grow in symbiosis with the elements material system.

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

* this could be the fire compartments in a building
* segments of an evacuation route..
* the sequence of fire detection, alert and sprinkling in a building.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

Next you should scope your investigation of the fire compartments / evacuation route or detection sequence. This is up to you to define.

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the fire compartments / evacuation route or detection sequence that are in the scope of your study.
