# Floor

>This system includes: The plenum, horizontal structure and services

The FLOOR system has a unique growth perspective because it is the first major segmentation of the building. It then 'grows' [structure] and [services] by branching them from the [core] in response to the needs of the spatial systems the FLOOR supports. In this way the function of the FLOOR is to support and supply the [space]s with their needs.

## M1 - Floor

## 1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

The FLOOR system has many elements. In this step please focus on the system and its element you wish to study further. It could be anything from the slab to the servicing, [fire] safety or structural elements.

## 1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

* Similar to the [facade], the FLOOR is organised on a surface
* It is also built up of layers on the surface which have a line tangential to the surface, describing the thickness of the layer.

## 1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

* This would be the layers of the FLOOR including the finished surface, the structural slab, the [structure] (beams) and [services] as well as any suspended ceilings or raised floors.
* Similar to the [facade] this would also include the spatial organisaiton of the FLOOR including the location of the [core] for instance.

## 1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

Next you should scope your investigation of the FLOOR layers and [space] system. This is up to you to define.

## 1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the FLOOR layers included in your study as well as features in the 'plan view' spatial organisation.
