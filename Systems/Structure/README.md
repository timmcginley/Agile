# Structure

>includes horizontal and veritcal structure.

The STRUCTURES system has a unique growth perspective because it 'grows' in response to the loads applied on it, initially from the spaces and then all the systems of the building. It transfers the loads of the builidng to the [site].

## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

The STRUCTURAL system includes the slabs, [core], columns, beams, bracing and others. In this stage you might want to either:
* look at the main STRUCTURAL concept and how this grows as well
* or a more detailed exploration of a specific interface between STRUCTURAL elements.

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

* This could be the centre of mass of the building
* and or the STRUCTURAL centres of STRUCTURAL elements

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

* This might be the [floor]s of the building, other spatial zones that segment the STRUCTURAL concept for the building
* or zones of compression and tension that provide the difference in the STRUCTURAL elements for instance.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

Next you should scope your investigation of the STRUCTURAL system or element segments. This is up to you to define.

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the STRUCTURAL segments that are in the scope of your study.
