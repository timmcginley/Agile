# Space

The SPACE system has a unique growth perspective because it provide the function and use for the building. The growth of every element in the building if because a space needs it. The function of the space is to support the needs of the users of the building and contain the stuff they need for that function.

## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

The space system is best represented as a graph. So that each space is a node representing its center point.

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

* Spaces elements provide the origin point for the other organising lines.
* It also includes the connections between the spaces representing their adjacent relationships to each other. These can be seen in the diagram above.

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

* This would be the vertical layers of the SPACE or
* This could be the spatial organisaiton of each space.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

Next you should scope your investigation of the SITE layers, segments and zones. This is up to you to define.

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the site layers included in your study as well as features in the 'plan view' spatial organisation.
