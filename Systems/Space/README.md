# Space

The SPACE system has a unique growth perspective because it provide the function and use for the building. The growth of every element in the building if because a SPACE needs it. The function of the SPACE is to support the needs of the users of the building and contain the stuff they need for that function.

## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

The SPACE system is best represented as a graph. So that each SPACE is a node representing its center point.

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

* SPACE elements provide the origin point for the organising lines of some other systems.
* It also includes the connections between the spaces representing their adjacent relationships to each other. These can be seen in the diagram above.

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

* This would be the vertical layers of the SPACE or
* This could be the spatial organisation of each SPACE.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

Next you should scope your investigation of the SPACE layers, segments and zones. This is up to you to define.

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the SPACE layers / segments / zones included in your study.
