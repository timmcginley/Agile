# Facade

The FACADE system has a unique growth perspective because it 'grows' on teh skin of the building. Its conceptual growth is therefore intently informed by the growth of the other systems. Whilst the FACADE decides lots of important features of a building susch as how much light it receives, in its growth process we could also say that it is the main sense of the building, sensing, where light is coming from throughout the year, moisture and air pressure levels outside. Therefore it would be good to think that the FACADE 'has time' to grow in its conceptual growth - at least a year, so it can experience all the conditions it will be expected to perform against in its final form. This is similar to the way that the space system should be 'grown' on the occupancy data of similar spaces. The most important thing for the facade system is to consider that it is the 'skin' of the building. The FACADE should be really good at sensing the outside, but also excel at adpating to the 'growing' needs of the building. It is probable that the FACADE is one of the last systems to activate its [material] system.

## AP1.1 Element
> Identify Element, Artefact or System

It is worth taking a step back to consider what you consider the FACADE to include. We have puposefully not included a roof system. So it is up to you to decide if you think that the roof is an extension of the FACADE or an exposed [floor].

## AP1.2 Line
> Check for Organising Line or Surface

* The FACADE is made of layers of skin that process light, heat, air (oxygen and CO2) and noise for the building.
* Further, what is known as the 'facade line' of the building is extruded over the building to form a 'facade surface' upon which glazed and non glazed zones are expressed. The layers of the FACADE described above are offset from the FACADE surface.

## AP1.3 Segments
> Identify Segments or Zones

* We have said above that the FACADE has layers, which should be further explored here.
* Additionally the FACADE lies on a surface. What are the segments / zones of the facade surface.

## AP1.4 Scope
> Define the Scope of the Study

Next you should scope your investigation of the FACADE layers / surface. You may for instance want to focus on the daylight, [fire] safety and or insulation. This is up to you to define.

## AP1.5 Features
> Identify Features

Here you need to identify the features for each of the segments that are in the scope of your study. For instance a feature might be that the glazing is shaded or that the verticality of the structure is expressed, or the design of ventilation ducts in the facade.
